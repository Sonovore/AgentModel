# Phase 1.2 Deep Research - Complexity Assessment and Routing

## Overview

Extracted 62 priority models from 14 disciplines. Scored complexity (0-12) using 6 dimensions:
1. Novelty (0-2)
2. Ambiguity (0-2)
3. Depth (0-2) - ALL research is deep (4+ layers) = 2 points baseline
4. Integration (0-2) - Cross-disciplinary needs
5. Abstraction (0-2) - Concrete vs philosophical
6. Stakes (0-2) - Quality requirements

**Routing:**
- Score 9-12 → `deep-research-complex` (Opus)
- Score 5-8 → `deep-research-simple` (Sonnet)
