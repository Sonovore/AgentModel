# AgentModel Tasks

## Active

- [ ] Create Task Breakdown skill - decompose goals into context-window-sized tasks
- [ ] Define "fits in one context window" heuristics
- [ ] Context window usage logging - track tasks using >80% context, by model/version
- [ ] Create `/assign` command - assign task to agent
- [ ] Create `/status` command - check agent status
- [ ] Create `/orchestrate` command - high-level orchestration

## Research

- [ ] Boyd's OODA Loop - Apply to agent decision cycles
  - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act
  - How does this map to agent task execution?

- [ ] Study Claude Code's built-in Task tool behavior
  - What agents are available?
  - How do they report back?
  - What are the limitations?

## Future

- [ ] Multi-agent coordination patterns
- [ ] Agent memory and state persistence
- [ ] Automated task breakdown (after manual patterns are established)
