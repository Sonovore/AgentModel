# Agile Scrum

Mental models from Agile Scrum methodology applied to AI agent sprint-based iteration, ceremony-based synchronization, and scaling frameworks.

## Purpose

Agile Scrum demonstrates coordination through structured ceremonies, iterative cycles, and artifact-driven decision-making. Rather than predicting all requirements upfront, Scrum embraces uncertainty and uses regular synchronization points to adapt. The framework shows how to maintain coherence while enabling team autonomy, and how to scale from small teams to larger organizations. These patterns address coordination through process discipline rather than top-down authority.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Iterative Cycles

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Sprint-Based Iteration | Scrum methodology | Time-boxed cycles with clear boundaries |
| Sprint Planning | Scrum ceremony | Coordinating on what will happen in the cycle |
| Sprint Goals | Scrum practice | Unifying agents around common objectives |
| Iteration Retrospectives | Agile practice | Learning and improving after each cycle |
| Velocity Tracking | Scrum metrics | Understanding agent throughput and capacity |

### Ceremony-Based Synchronization

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Daily Standup | Scrum ceremony | Regular synchronization without extended meetings |
| Sprint Review | Scrum ceremony | Demonstrating progress to stakeholders |
| Backlog Refinement | Scrum practice | Preparing work before it's attempted |
| Ceremony Discipline | Agile operations | Regular, predictable synchronization points |
| Timeboxing | Agile practice | Limiting meetings to fixed durations |

### Roles and Clarity

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Role Clarity | Scrum structure | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team clearly distinguished |
| Product Owner Authority | Scrum practice | Single person prioritizing what matters |
| Scrum Master Facilitation | Scrum role | Removing obstacles to agent productivity |
| Team Autonomy | Scrum philosophy | Agents deciding how to accomplish goals |
| Cross-Functional Teams | Agile practice | Teams with diverse skills |

### Artifact-Driven Coordination

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Product Backlog | Scrum artifact | Prioritized list of work to be done |
| Sprint Backlog | Scrum artifact | What agents commit to this cycle |
| Definition of Done | Scrum artifact | Shared understanding of completion |
| Burndown Charts | Agile metrics | Visible progress toward sprint goals |
| Increment | Scrum artifact | Potentially releasable product each sprint |

### Scaling Frameworks

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Scaling Frameworks (SAFe, LeSS, Nexus) | Agile scaling | Coordinating multiple agent teams |
| Scrum of Scrums | SAFe approach | Coordinating across teams |
| Feature Teams | Scaling practice | Teams organized around customer features |
| Synchronized Sprints | Scaling practice | Multiple teams using common iteration cycles |
| Cross-Team Dependencies | Scaling challenge | Coordination between teams |

### Continuous Improvement

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Retrospective-Driven Improvement | Agile practice | Learning from each cycle |
| Velocity Trending | Scrum metrics | Understanding improvement over time |
| Technical Debt Management | Agile practice | Balancing new features with maintenance |
| Experimentation | Agile culture | Testing changes before committing fully |
| Hybrid Approaches | Modern practice | Combining Scrum with other methodologies |

## Priority Assessment

| Model | Relevance | Complexity | Suggested Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Sprint-Based Iteration** | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| **Role Clarity** | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| **Ceremony-Based Synchronization** | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| **Product Backlog** | High | Low | 1 |
| **Sprint Goals** | High | Medium | 1 |
| **Artifact-Driven Coordination** | High | Low | 2 |
| **Scaling Frameworks** | High | High | 2 |
| **Definition of Done** | High | Low | 2 |
| **Retrospective-Driven Improvement** | Medium | Medium | 2 |

## Key Questions

1. How do you translate "sprint" cycles to AI agent execution - what's the duration?
2. What ceremonies make sense for purely computational agents?
3. What artifacts would constitute an agent product backlog?
4. How do you define "done" for agent work?
5. Can agents participate in retrospectives - learning and improving?
6. How do you apply scaling frameworks to coordinating agent teams?
7. What's the agent equivalent of "velocity" - how to measure throughput?
