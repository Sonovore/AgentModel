# Military Coordination

Mental models from military coordination theory applied to AI agent orchestration.

## Purpose

Military organizations have developed sophisticated frameworks for coordinating action across distributed units with limited communication, incomplete information, and adversarial conditions. These patterns directly apply to multi-agent systems.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Combined Arms & Joint Operations

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Combined Arms Warfare | Military doctrine | Integrating different capabilities for synergistic effect |
| Joint Operations | US Joint doctrine | Coordinating across service branches (different "agent types") |
| Interoperability | NATO STANAG | Standards enabling different systems to work together |
| Synchronization Matrix | Planning doctrine | Time-phased coordination of activities |
| Main Effort / Supporting Effort | Maneuver doctrine | Prioritizing resources toward decisive action |

### Coordination Mechanisms

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Control Measures | Tactical doctrine | Boundaries, phase lines, checkpoints for deconfliction |
| Fire Support Coordination | Artillery doctrine | Preventing fratricide while enabling support |
| Airspace Coordination | Air doctrine | Managing shared space with multiple actors |
| Liaison Officers | Military practice | Human bridges between units for coordination |
| Common Operating Picture | C4ISR | Shared situational awareness across units |

### Synchronization Concepts

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| H-Hour / D-Day | Planning conventions | Reference points for synchronized action |
| Phase Lines | Ground doctrine | Geographic triggers for transitions |
| Sequels and Branches | Planning doctrine | Pre-planned adaptations to changing situations |
| Rehearsals | Training doctrine | Coordination through practice before execution |

## Priority Assessment

| Model | Relevance | Complexity | Suggested Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Combined Arms | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| Main Effort / Supporting Effort | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| Control Measures | High | Medium | 1 |
| Common Operating Picture | High | Medium | 1 |
| Synchronization Matrix | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| Liaison Officers | Medium | Low | 2 |
| Fire Support Coordination | Medium | High | 3 |

## Key Questions

1. How do you coordinate agents with different capabilities for synergistic effect?
2. What's the agent equivalent of "control measures" - preventing agents from interfering with each other?
3. How do you establish a "common operating picture" across agents?
4. What's "main effort" for agent systems - how do you prioritize resources?
5. How do you synchronize agent actions in time without tight coupling?
