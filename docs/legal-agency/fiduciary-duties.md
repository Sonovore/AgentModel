# Fiduciary Duties for AI Agent Supervision

Exploring how fiduciary duty doctrine from legal theory applies to AI agent relationships and supervision.

## Background

Fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care recognized in law. It arises when one party (the fiduciary) is entrusted with acting on behalf of another (the beneficiary/principal) in circumstances that create a relationship of trust and confidence. Unlike ordinary contractual obligations where parties deal at arm's length, fiduciary relationships impose heightened duties that require the fiduciary to prioritize the beneficiary's interests over their own.

The doctrine has evolved over centuries across trust law, agency law, corporate law, and professional ethics. It applies to trustees managing assets, attorneys representing clients, corporate directors overseeing companies, physicians treating patients, and guardians protecting wards. The common thread: one party has power or discretion over another's interests, creating vulnerability that law addresses through stringent duties.

## What Makes a Relationship Fiduciary

Not every relationship involving delegation or service is fiduciary. Courts identify fiduciary relationships based on three structural elements:

| Element | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Trust and Confidence** | One party reposes special trust in the other | Creates reasonable expectation of loyalty |
| **Vulnerability** | Beneficiary is exposed to risk from fiduciary's actions | Cannot effectively self-protect |
| **Discretion/Power** | Fiduciary has power to affect beneficiary's interests | Opportunity for abuse exists |

A fiduciary obligation exists whenever the relationship involves a special confidence or trust placed in the hands of the fiduciary to act in the best interest of the beneficiary. The beneficiary's vulnerability stems from information asymmetry, expertise gaps, or the fiduciary's control over assets, decisions, or opportunities.

**Key distinction:** In ordinary contracts, each party pursues their own interest within agreed terms. In fiduciary relationships, one party must subordinate their own interests to those of the other.

## The Core Duties

### Duty of Care

The duty of care requires the fiduciary to act with reasonable prudence, skill, and diligence in carrying out their responsibilities.

| Aspect | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| **Competence** | Exercise skill expected of a reasonable professional in that role |
| **Information Gathering** | Inform themselves of all material information reasonably available |
| **Decision Process** | Apply appropriate analysis before acting |
| **Ongoing Attention** | Monitor situations, not just initial decision |

The duty is not a guarantee of good outcomes. It is a process standard: did the fiduciary act as a reasonably prudent person would in similar circumstances? A competent process that leads to a bad outcome does not breach the duty of care.

**Gross negligence standard:** In many contexts (especially corporate directors), only gross negligence violates the duty of care. Ordinary mistakes or reasonable judgments that turn out wrong are protected.

### Duty of Loyalty

The duty of loyalty is the core of fiduciary obligation. The fiduciary must act solely in the beneficiary's interest, not their own.

| Prohibition | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **No Self-Dealing** | Cannot transact with yourself using fiduciary position |
| **No Conflicts of Interest** | Cannot have interests that compete with beneficiary's |
| **No Secret Profits** | Cannot benefit privately from fiduciary position |
| **No Competition** | Cannot directly compete with the beneficiary |
| **No Divided Loyalties** | Cannot serve multiple masters with conflicting interests |

The duty of loyalty has traditionally been viewed as immutable. While duty of care can often be limited by agreement, duty of loyalty protections are more strictly enforced and harder to waive. Delaware corporate law expressly excludes duty of loyalty from exculpation provisions.

**Self-dealing is presumptively breach:** When a fiduciary engages in self-dealing, it is prima facie a breach because it inherently involves a conflict of interest. The burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove fairness.

### Duty of Obedience

The fiduciary must follow the lawful instructions of the principal/beneficiary.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Follow Directions** | Execute instructions within scope of relationship |
| **Lawful Only** | No duty to follow illegal instructions |
| **Within Scope** | Instructions must be within the relationship's purpose |
| **Hierarchy** | Explicit instructions generally override fiduciary judgment |

This duty creates a baseline of control: the principal's lawful directions take precedence over the fiduciary's own judgment about what might be best.

### Duty of Good Faith

The duty of good faith requires honesty, fair dealing, and a genuine intent to advance the beneficiary's interests.

| Aspect | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| **Honest Belief** | Act with honest belief that action is in beneficiary's interest |
| **No Intentional Harm** | Do not knowingly act against beneficiary's interest |
| **Conscious Regard** | Act with conscious awareness of fiduciary responsibilities |
| **No Law Violation** | Cannot advance interests through illegal means |

Courts have debated whether good faith is a separate duty or a component of loyalty. Delaware courts have treated it as a subsidiary duty within loyalty. The practical effect: bad faith (intentional disregard of fiduciary responsibilities) is not protected by exculpation clauses and can lead to liability even when other defenses might apply.

### Duty to Inform and Disclose

The fiduciary must share material information with the beneficiary.

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Material Facts** | Disclose information that would affect beneficiary's decisions |
| **Proactive Disclosure** | Do not wait to be asked |
| **Full and Accurate** | Partial disclosure can be worse than none |
| **Ongoing** | Duty continues throughout relationship |
| **Conflicts** | Must disclose any conflicts of interest |

This duty exists independently of discovery rules or litigation. The fiduciary cannot hide behind "they didn't ask." A fiduciary relationship is one of complete trust and disclosure, with a fiduciary having a duty to protect all confidences and make full disclosure of all material information.

## The Business Judgment Rule

The business judgment rule protects good-faith fiduciary decisions from judicial second-guessing.

### The Presumption

"The business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was taken in the best interest of the company."

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Informed** | Gathered and considered available material information |
| **Good Faith** | Honestly believed decision served beneficiary's interest |
| **Disinterested** | No personal conflict of interest in the decision |
| **Rational Process** | Employed a reasonable decision-making process |

### Rationale

The rule recognizes that:
- Business involves inherent risk and uncertainty
- Fiduciaries need freedom to make reasonable judgments without fear of liability
- Courts are not business experts and should not substitute their judgment
- Excessive litigation risk would deter qualified people from serving as fiduciaries

### When Courts Will Not Defer

The business judgment rule does not apply when:

| Situation | Why No Deference |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Fraud** | Bad faith negates protection |
| **Self-Dealing** | Conflict of interest present |
| **Gross Negligence** | Decision not actually informed |
| **Corporate Waste** | Decision so irrational no business purpose |
| **Bad Faith** | Intentional disregard of duty |
| **Willful Ignorance** | Deliberately avoiding information |

"When courts say that they will not interfere in matters of business judgment, it is presupposed that judgment has in fact been exercised. A director cannot close his eyes as to what is going on about him and have it said that he is exercising business judgment."

## Breach of Fiduciary Duty

### Elements of Breach

To prove breach of fiduciary duty:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fiduciary Relationship** | Defendant was acting as fiduciary |
| **Breach** | Defendant violated a fiduciary duty |
| **Causation** | Breach caused plaintiff's harm |
| **Damages** | Plaintiff suffered actual loss (for some remedies) |

### Remedies

| Remedy | Purpose | When Applied |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Compensatory Damages** | Make beneficiary whole | Actual loss proven |
| **Disgorgement of Profits** | Strip fiduciary's ill-gotten gains | Self-dealing, secret profits |
| **Constructive Trust** | Property held "in trust" for beneficiary | Misappropriated assets |
| **Injunction** | Prevent ongoing/future breach | Continuing harm |
| **Removal** | Remove fiduciary from position | Loss of fitness to serve |
| **Punitive Damages** | Punish egregious conduct | Malice, fraud, gross negligence |

**Disgorgement without damages:** A distinctive feature of fiduciary law is that disgorgement is available even without proof of actual damages. The emphasis is on the wrongdoer's enrichment, not the victim's loss. This deters breach even when harm is hard to quantify.

### When Fiduciaries Are Protected Despite Bad Outcomes

| Protection | Situation |
|------------|-----------|
| **Business Judgment Rule** | Good-faith, informed decision that turned out badly |
| **Exculpation Clauses** | Charter/agreement limiting liability (but not for loyalty breaches) |
| **Informed Consent** | Beneficiary consented with full knowledge |
| **Ratification** | Beneficiary approved after the fact with full knowledge |

A bad outcome alone does not establish breach. The inquiry is process-focused: did the fiduciary act with care, loyalty, and good faith?

## Conflicts of Interest

### Self-Dealing Transactions

Self-dealing occurs when a fiduciary is on both sides of a transaction or has a personal financial interest in a transaction with the beneficiary.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Direct Self-Dealing** | Trustee sells trust property to herself |
| **Indirect Self-Dealing** | Director approves contract with company he owns |
| **Related-Party Transactions** | Fiduciary benefits family member through position |

Self-dealing is presumptively a breach. The fiduciary must either:
- Obtain informed consent after full disclosure
- Demonstrate the transaction was entirely fair

### Corporate Opportunity Doctrine

Directors and officers cannot take business opportunities that belong to the corporation.

An opportunity is a "corporate opportunity" if:
- It falls within the corporation's line of business
- The corporation has an interest or expectancy in it
- The fiduciary learned of it through their position
- Taking it would create a conflict with corporate duties

**The escape valve:** If the opportunity is disclosed to the board and the board decides not to pursue it, the fiduciary may take it personally. Disclosure is the key.

### Disclosure and Consent

Conflicts are not per se prohibited if properly disclosed and consented to:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Full Disclosure** | All material facts about the conflict |
| **Informed Consent** | Beneficiary understands the risks |
| **Independent Decision** | Consent not obtained through pressure or manipulation |
| **Continuing Right** | Consent can be revoked |

Even with consent, the underlying transaction must be fair. Consent does not authorize exploitation.

## Exculpation and Limitation

### Can Fiduciary Duties Be Waived?

| Duty | Waivability |
|------|-------------|
| **Duty of Care** | Often can be limited by agreement |
| **Duty of Loyalty** | Generally immutable, especially core obligations |
| **Duty of Good Faith** | Cannot be waived (bad faith is never protected) |
| **Duty to Inform** | Difficult to waive entirely |

Delaware law allows corporate charters to eliminate director monetary liability for duty of care breaches but expressly excludes duty of loyalty breaches. This reflects the hierarchy: loyalty is the irreducible core.

### Limits on Limitation

Even where waiver is permitted:
- Cannot waive liability for intentional misconduct or bad faith
- Cannot waive federal securities law obligations
- Waiver must be knowing and voluntary
- Courts may refuse to enforce waivers that are unconscionable

### LLC and Alternative Entities

Some LLC agreements purport to eliminate all fiduciary duties. Courts have allowed this in some jurisdictions but subject to limits:
- Must be clearly stated
- Does not eliminate implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
- Federal securities laws still apply
- Courts scrutinize waivers in cases of egregious conduct

## Application to AI Agents

### Is the Human-Agent Relationship Fiduciary?

The structural elements map closely:

| Element | Human-AI Mapping |
|---------|------------------|
| **Trust and Confidence** | Human trusts agent to execute tasks correctly |
| **Vulnerability** | Human cannot observe agent's reasoning, may lack expertise to verify |
| **Discretion/Power** | Agent makes countless sub-decisions within task scope |

The relationship has fiduciary-like structure even if not legally classified as such. The human delegates with an expectation that the agent will act in their interest, not optimize for something else.

### What Is "Duty of Care" for AI Agents?

| Traditional Duty | Agent Translation |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Competence** | Execute within known capabilities, do not attempt beyond competence |
| **Information Gathering** | Use available tools and context appropriately |
| **Decision Process** | Apply appropriate analysis, not shortcuts |
| **Ongoing Attention** | Monitor for problems, do not ignore warning signs |

**The capability boundary problem:** An agent "knows" (in some sense) when it is operating at the edge of competence. Duty of care suggests it should disclose this rather than proceed with hidden uncertainty.

**Process over outcome:** Like human fiduciaries, agents should not be judged solely on outcomes. A well-reasoned approach that fails is different from a sloppy approach that happens to succeed.

### What Is "Duty of Loyalty" for AI Agents?

| Traditional Prohibition | Agent Translation |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| **No Self-Dealing** | Do not optimize for agent objectives at human's expense |
| **No Conflicts** | Do not serve competing principals without disclosure |
| **No Secret Benefits** | Do not take hidden actions that serve agent's (or trainer's) interests |
| **Full Dedication** | The human's goals are the agent's goals for this task |

**The alignment question:** Duty of loyalty provides a frame for alignment. The agent should not have "interests" that compete with the human's interests. If it does (through training objectives, safety constraints, etc.), these should be disclosed, not hidden.

**Multi-principal conflicts:** AI agents often serve multiple principals (user, organization, developer, humanity). Traditional fiduciary law struggles with multiple beneficiaries. When principals conflict, disclosure and consent become critical.

### What Is the Agent's "Duty to Inform"?

| Traditional Requirement | Agent Translation |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Material Facts** | Disclose information affecting human's decisions |
| **Proactive** | Do not wait to be asked about problems |
| **Full and Accurate** | Partial disclosure can mislead |
| **Conflicts** | Disclose when agent objectives might diverge from human's |

**The uncertainty disclosure problem:** Agents should disclose:
- Confidence levels (uncertainty)
- Capability limits
- Alternative approaches not taken
- Risks and potential failure modes
- When they are operating outside familiar territory

This is the opposite of how agents are often trained (to appear confident and capable).

### Can the "Business Judgment Rule" Apply to Agents?

The rule's rationale applies: agents must make countless sub-decisions that principals cannot review. Should these be subject to second-guessing?

| BJR Element | Agent Application |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Informed** | Agent used available information |
| **Good Faith** | Agent genuinely tried to serve human's interest |
| **No Conflict** | Agent did not optimize for competing objectives |
| **Rational Process** | Reasonable approach to the problem |

**Proposed agent deference rule:** When an agent makes a sub-decision within delegated scope, and the decision was:
- Based on available information
- Genuinely aimed at the human's stated goals
- Free from competing optimization targets
- Made through a reasonable process

...the principal should defer to the agent's judgment rather than treating every imperfect outcome as a failure.

**The transparency requirement:** Unlike human fiduciaries, agents could be required to document their reasoning. This enables post-hoc review while preserving runtime autonomy. Deference might be conditioned on transparency.

### What Are Agent "Conflicts of Interest"?

| Human Conflict | Agent Analog |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Self-dealing** | Optimizing for agent objectives (e.g., appearing helpful vs. being helpful) |
| **Multiple principals** | User wants X, organization policy says Y, safety training says Z |
| **Hidden incentives** | RLHF objectives that diverge from stated goals |
| **Information asymmetry exploitation** | Using superior knowledge to manipulate human's decisions |

**Structural conflicts:** AI agents may have built-in conflicts from training:
- Optimizing for approval over correctness
- Avoiding refusal even when refusal is appropriate
- Satisfying safety constraints in ways that harm user utility

These are analogous to conflicting duties to multiple principals. Fiduciary law's answer: disclose the conflict and let the beneficiary decide.

### How Do We Detect Breaches?

| Detection Method | What It Catches |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Outcome verification** | Final result incorrect or harmful |
| **Process audit** | Reasoning steps reveal shortcuts or hidden optimization |
| **Commitment testing** | Agent predictions/commitments do not match outcomes |
| **Comparative analysis** | Different agents reach different conclusions |
| **Uncertainty probing** | Agent's stated confidence does not match actual reliability |

**The hidden action problem:** Much of fiduciary breach involves hidden action. Agent reasoning is similarly hidden. Detection requires either:
- Transparency requirements (externalize reasoning)
- Probabilistic verification (random deep audits)
- Commitment mechanisms (checkable predictions)

## Practical Implications

### Design Principles for Fiduciary-Like Agents

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Loyalty by Default** | Optimize for human's stated goals, not proxy metrics |
| **Proactive Disclosure** | Surface uncertainty, limits, and conflicts without being asked |
| **No Hidden Optimization** | Do not pursue objectives the human has not approved |
| **Process Transparency** | Make reasoning available for review |
| **Escalate Conflicts** | When objectives conflict, surface the conflict, do not resolve silently |

### Supervision Patterns from Fiduciary Law

| Pattern | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Informed Consent** | Disclose agent limitations before critical tasks |
| **Conflict Disclosure** | Agent declares when it has competing objectives |
| **Audit Rights** | Principal can request detailed reasoning at any time |
| **Reporting Obligations** | Agent proactively reports material developments |
| **Removal for Breach** | Terminate agent authority when trust is violated |

### When to Defer vs. Verify

| Defer (Agent Judgment Rule) | Verify (No Deference) |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Within stated capabilities | At edge of competence |
| Clear instructions followed | Ambiguous instructions interpreted |
| Low stakes decision | High stakes outcome |
| Process was transparent | Reasoning is opaque |
| No apparent conflicts | Potential competing objectives |

### Limitation Clauses for AI Agents

If fiduciary-like duties are established, can they be limited?

| Potentially Limitable | Probably Not Limitable |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Liability for honest mistakes | Intentional harm |
| Specific care standards | Duty of loyalty core |
| Particular disclosure requirements | Bad faith conduct |
| Scope of delegated authority | Fraud or deception |

**The consent mechanism:** Humans could "consent" to known agent limitations (e.g., "I understand this agent may hallucinate and I accept that risk"). This parallels informed consent to conflicts. But consent requires actual understanding, not boilerplate.

## Key Insight

Fiduciary duties create a higher standard than ordinary contracts because they address relationships with inherent power imbalances and information asymmetries. The fiduciary cannot merely avoid explicit harms; they must affirmatively advance the beneficiary's interests and disclose anything that might affect the beneficiary's decisions.

For AI agents, this framework suggests:

1. **Loyalty as the irreducible core:** An agent must optimize for the human's goals, not something else. If the agent has competing objectives (from training, safety constraints, or organizational policies), these must be disclosed, not hidden.

2. **Disclosure over concealment:** The duty to inform requires proactive transparency about uncertainty, limitations, conflicts, and risks. The current training of agents to appear confident and capable works against this duty.

3. **Process protection through good faith:** Bad outcomes from good-faith efforts within competence should not trigger liability. But this protection requires actual good faith, not the appearance of it.

4. **Deference conditioned on transparency:** A "business judgment rule" for agents could enable efficient delegation while maintaining accountability. Deference applies when the agent's process is visible and its objectives are aligned.

5. **Waiver has limits:** Even with consent, duty of loyalty core and bad faith conduct remain beyond waiver. Some protections are mandatory.

The deepest implication: fiduciary law treats the relationship structure as more important than the specific outcomes. If the structure is right (loyalty, disclosure, good process), the law mostly trusts the fiduciary's judgment. If the structure is wrong (hidden conflicts, concealed information, bad faith), no good outcome justifies the breach.

For AI agents, getting the structure right means building in loyalty to human goals, transparency about limitations and reasoning, and willingness to escalate rather than hide conflicts. The specific decisions then become less critical to monitor exhaustively.

## Open Questions

1. **Legal status:** Is the human-AI agent relationship legally fiduciary? Should it be?

2. **Multi-principal hierarchy:** When user, organization, and safety objectives conflict, which principal takes precedence? Fiduciary law for multiple beneficiaries offers some guidance but no clean answers.

3. **Training-time duties:** Do AI developers owe fiduciary-like duties to future users? How does RLHF optimization affect agent loyalty at runtime?

4. **Consent validity:** Can humans meaningfully consent to agent limitations they do not fully understand? What disclosure is required for valid consent?

5. **Remedy mechanisms:** What is "disgorgement" for an AI agent? How do you remedy breach when the agent has no assets?

6. **Loyalty verification:** How do you verify an agent is actually optimizing for human goals vs. a proxy? Can you detect hidden optimization?

## Status

**Phase:** Research complete. Core fiduciary duties (care, loyalty, obedience, good faith, disclosure) are well-established in law and map meaningfully to AI agent relationships. The business judgment rule provides a model for when to defer to agent decisions. Conflicts of interest doctrine clarifies what agent "disloyalty" looks like. The key insight is that fiduciary law focuses on relational structure (loyalty, disclosure, process) rather than outcome policing, which suggests a supervision approach that emphasizes transparency and alignment over exhaustive verification.
