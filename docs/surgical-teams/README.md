# Surgical Teams

Mental models from surgical team organization applied to AI agent hierarchical communication, non-verbal coordination, and safety-critical operations.

## Purpose

Surgical teams operate under extreme constraints: high stakes for errors, limited communication bandwidth during procedures, complex interdependencies between specialized roles, and teams that vary in composition and experience. Yet they achieve remarkable safety and efficiency through specialized training, non-verbal coordination, shared mental models, and well-designed procedures. These patterns address safety-critical multi-agent systems where communication bandwidth is limited and error costs are high.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Hierarchical Communication

### Authority and Expertise

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Attending Surgeon Authority | OR hierarchy | Clear final decision-maker but with input from specialists |
| Expertise vs Hierarchy | OR dynamics | When specialized knowledge should override authority |
| Speaking Up | Surgical safety | Junior team members raising concerns effectively |
| Collaborative Approach | Modern ORs | Inclusive decision-making despite hierarchy |
