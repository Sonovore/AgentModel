# Boyd's OODA Loop: Three-Level Explanation

## Level 1: Ages 5-10

### The Mystery of the Slower Airplane

In 1950, American pilots flew into a war in Korea. They had airplanes called F-86 Sabres. The enemy had airplanes called MiG-15s.

Here's the strange thing: **The MiG was a better airplane.** It could fly higher. It could climb faster. On paper, the MiG should have won every fight.

But something weird happened. American pilots in their "worse" airplanes won **ten fights for every one they lost.**

A man named John Boyd wanted to know why. He spent years figuring it out.

**The Answer: Seeing and Understanding**

The F-86 had a big glass bubble around the pilot's head. The pilot could look everywhere - up, down, left, right, even behind. It was like sitting inside a fishbowl.

The MiG had metal bars across the glass. The pilot could only see straight ahead. It was like looking through a window with a fence in front of it.

The American pilots could SEE better. And when you can see better, you can UNDERSTAND what's happening faster.

**The Four Steps (Done Over and Over)**

Boyd figured out that every fight is really the same four steps, done again and again:

1. **LOOK** - See what's happening around you
2. **UNDERSTAND** - Figure out what the other person is trying to do
3. **CHOOSE** - Pick what you're going to do
4. **DO IT** - Actually do it, then look around again

The American pilots did these four steps FASTER because they could see better. By the time the MiG pilot figured out where the American plane went, the American was already behind him, doing the steps again.

**The Really Cool Part: Skipping the Middle**

Boyd discovered something else. The very best pilots didn't think about step 3 (Choose). They would LOOK, UNDERSTAND, and then their hands would just MOVE. No choosing - they already knew what to do.

It's like catching a ball. When you're little, you think: "Ball is coming... put hands up... close hands NOW." But after lots of practice, you just see the ball and catch it. You don't think about it.

Boyd said the best pilots had practiced so much that understanding and doing became the same thing.

**The Big Lesson**

John Boyd taught us something important: **The person who understands fastest wins, even with worse stuff.**

It's not about who has the best toys. It's about who figures things out fastest.

### The Fighter Pilot Who Changed Military Thinking

In the skies over Korea from 1950 to 1953, American F-86 Sabre pilots achieved something that seemed impossible: a 10-to-1 kill ratio against Soviet-designed MiG-15s. This demanded explanation because:

- The MiG-15 had a higher service ceiling (50,000 ft vs. 48,000 ft)
- The MiG-15 had a better thrust-to-weight ratio
- The MiG-15 could turn tighter at high altitude
- The MiG-15 had heavier armament (cannons vs. machine guns)

Colonel John Boyd, an Air Force fighter pilot and military theorist, spent years analyzing this puzzle. His conclusion revolutionized military thinking: **the F-86's advantages were informational, not mechanical.**

**The F-86's Hidden Advantages**

The F-86 had two critical features the MiG lacked:

1. **Bubble canopy**: Unobstructed 360-degree visibility. The MiG-15's canopy had structural bars that created blind spots, and rear visibility was severely limited.

2. **Fully hydraulic controls**: The F-86's control stick moved easily in any position. The MiG-15 had mechanical controls that became progressively harder to move at high speed, creating lag between pilot intention and aircraft response.

These weren't about flying faster or turning tighter. They were about **seeing sooner** and **responding quicker**. The F-86 pilot could observe the battlefield and translate decisions into action faster than the MiG pilot.

**The OODA Loop**

Boyd formalized this insight into a framework he called the OODA Loop:

**Observe** - Gather information from your environment
- The F-86 pilot's bubble canopy gave superior observation
- You can't respond to what you don't see

**Orient** - Process information through your mental models, training, and experience
- "Given his altitude, airspeed, and heading, he's setting up a high-side gun run"
- This is where everything happens - observation means nothing without interpretation

**Decide** - Select an action based on your orientation
- "I'll pull into a climbing left turn to get on his six"

**Act** - Execute and observe the results
- Pull the stick, add throttle, check the result
- The enemy reacts, and the loop begins again

**The Critical Insight: Orient is Everything**

Boyd's key discovery was that **Orient** is the schwerpunkt - the focal point where the battle is won or lost. Your observations are filtered through orientation. Your decisions emerge from orientation. Your actions test orientation.

If your orientation is wrong, perfect observation and brilliant decision-making still produce the wrong action. You saw accurately, you decided logically, but you lost because you were working from the wrong mental model.

Boyd identified five elements that shape orientation:

1. **Genetic heritage** - Your innate cognitive patterns and limitations
2. **Cultural traditions** - The patterns you absorbed from your environment
3. **Previous experiences** - What you've learned from the past
4. **New information** - What you're currently observing
5. **Analysis and synthesis** - The process of integrating all the above

**The Fast Path: Implicit Guidance and Control**

Here's what separates Boyd's framework from a simple decision cycle: experienced practitioners don't actually use all four steps. Boyd's actual diagram shows a **direct path from Orient to Act that bypasses Decide entirely.**

Boyd called this Implicit Guidance and Control (IG&C). When a fighter pilot has internalized patterns through extensive training, they recognize a situation and their body responds without conscious decision. They see the geometry, recognize the pattern, and act - all in one fluid motion.

This is why Boyd emphasized that Orient "generates" the other elements. A highly developed orientation doesn't just inform decisions - it eliminates the need for explicit decision-making in familiar situations.

The goal of training isn't to make better decisions. It's to develop orientation so thoroughly that decisions become automatic.

**Getting Inside the Opponent's Loop**

Boyd's tactical application: **operate inside your opponent's OODA loop.** If you can complete your observe-orient-decide-act cycle before your opponent finishes theirs, you force them to react to a situation that no longer exists. They're orienting to where you were, not where you are.

This creates cascading disorientation. Each time they try to orient, you've already changed the situation. They're perpetually one cycle behind, reacting to outdated information, unable to gain initiative.

The F-86 pilots dominated not because they were better pilots in some abstract sense, but because their aircraft let them cycle faster. The MiG pilot would complete his orient phase only to discover the F-86 was no longer where he expected - because the F-86 pilot had already acted and observed again.

**Incestuous Amplification: When Orientation Corrupts Observation**

Boyd warned about a dangerous failure mode: **orientation shapes what you observe.** You tend to see evidence that confirms your existing mental model and filter out evidence that contradicts it.

He called this "incestuous amplification" - a feedback loop where wrong orientation biases observation, which reinforces wrong orientation, which further biases observation.

**Vietnam War example:** American military leadership oriented around the assumption that conventional military metrics (body counts, territory held, sorties flown) indicated progress. This orientation filtered observations - reports confirming "progress" were amplified; reports suggesting the strategy was failing were dismissed. The orientation was fundamentally wrong (the war was political, not military), but observations were systematically filtered to confirm it.

**Antidote:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Don't just ask "what supports my view?" Ask "what would I observe if my view is wrong?" Boyd argued that destruction of inadequate mental models was as important as creation of new ones.

**Tempo vs. Speed**

Boyd distinguished between **speed** (raw velocity) and **tempo** (rhythm and cadence). The goal isn't just to move fast - it's to control the rhythm of engagement.

This requires two things:
- **Variety**: A range of available options
- **Rapidity**: Speed of cycling through those options

Fast cycling through limited options is predictable - you move quickly but the opponent can anticipate you. Broad options without rapid cycling means opportunities expire before you can exploit them. You need both.

**Why This Matters Beyond Dogfights**

Boyd spent his later career applying OODA to business, politics, and any competitive situation. The framework reveals that competitive advantage comes not from superior resources but from superior orientation and faster cycling.

A startup can defeat an established competitor by cycling faster - observing market changes, orienting to new opportunities, deciding and acting before the larger organization completes its first decision cycle. The competitor isn't slower because they're stupid; they're slower because organizational mass creates orientation lag.

A student who understands the underlying principles (good orientation) outperforms one who memorized more facts (good observation) because when the test presents novel problems, orientation generates options while observation alone generates nothing.

Boyd's insight was that almost every "decision problem" is actually an orientation problem. When you're stuck, more information rarely helps. What helps is questioning whether your fundamental understanding is correct.

## Level 3: Expert

### Boyd's Theory of Competitive Adaptation: A Complete Framework

John Boyd's OODA Loop is routinely trivialized as a four-step decision cycle. This misses almost everything Boyd actually taught. The OODA Loop is better understood as a theory of competitive adaptation grounded in a specific epistemology, with orientation as the generative center of a complex network of feedback relationships.

**Epistemological Foundation: Destruction and Creation**

Boyd's 1976 paper "Destruction and Creation" provides the philosophical foundation for OODA. Drawing on Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Boyd argued for an irreducible limitation on any mental model of reality:

1. **Godel**: No logical system can be both complete and consistent - there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within the system
2. **Heisenberg**: Measurement at sufficient precision necessarily disturbs the system being measured - perfect observation is impossible
3. **Second Law**: Entropy increases in closed systems - mental models degrade over time unless actively maintained

From these, Boyd derived a fundamental epistemological claim: **no mental model can perfectly match reality, and all mental models degrade over time.** This isn't a temporary limitation awaiting better technology - it's a structural feature of the relationship between mind and world.

The response Boyd advocated was a continuous cycle of:

**Destructive Deduction**: Disassemble existing mental models into constituent components. Take apart the conceptual frameworks you're using. Identify the assumptions, the inferences, the categories. Question which elements are load-bearing and which are decoration.

**Creative Induction**: Reassemble components into novel configurations. Combine elements from different frameworks. Synthesize new patterns that better match current observations.

This is not passive learning or information accumulation. It's **active destruction of inadequate models followed by reconstruction.** An organization that only accumulates information without questioning its interpretive frameworks will develop increasingly sophisticated wrong answers.

**The Structure of Orientation**

Orientation is not a single variable but a synthesis of five elements:

| Element | Description | Characteristic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Genetic Heritage** | Innate cognitive architecture, evolved heuristics, biological constraints | Essentially fixed; provides the substrate for everything else |
| **Cultural Traditions** | Absorbed patterns from environment, professional training, organizational norms | Slowly changing; provides baseline orientation for novel situations |
| **Previous Experiences** | Personal history of successes and failures, pattern library | Continuously updated; the raw material for pattern recognition |
| **New Information** | Current observations, incoming data | Rapidly changing; the trigger for re-orientation |
| **Analysis & Synthesis** | The destruction/creation engine, the process of integrating the above | The only active element; everything else is input |

Critical insight: **four of these are inputs, one is process.** Most optimization efforts focus on inputs - better documentation (cultural traditions), more context (previous experiences), more observations (new information). Little attention goes to the synthesis mechanism itself.

Yet the synthesis mechanism is what transforms inputs into actionable orientation. An agent with perfect inputs but broken synthesis is worse than an agent with imperfect inputs but strong synthesis capability. The latter can compensate; the former cannot.

**The Architecture of Boyd's Actual Diagram**

Boyd's mature OODA diagram (circa 1995) is not a simple loop. It's a network with multiple feedback paths:

```
                        Implicit Guidance & Control
                 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                 │                                         │
                 │                                         v
OBSERVE ──────>  │   ORIENT  ──────────────────────>   DECIDE  ──────>  ACT
   ^             │     │                                  │              │
   │             │     │                                  │              │
   │             │     │  ┌───────────────────────────────┘              │
   │             │     │  │     (Feedback)                              │
   │             │     v  v                                              │
   │             └────────────────────────────────────────────>          │
   │                                                                     │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           (Feedback)
```

Three feedback paths, not one:
1. **Act → Observe**: Results of action become new observations (the obvious loop)
2. **Orient → Act (IG&C)**: Direct pathway bypassing explicit decision - this is the fast path for experts
3. **Decide → Orient and Act → Orient**: Continuous refinement of orientation based on both planning and results

The Orient → Act pathway is crucial. Boyd observed that expert practitioners in time-critical domains don't make explicit decisions. They recognize patterns and respond. The decision is implicit in the situation recognition. A chess grandmaster doesn't consciously evaluate each move - they see the board and the move suggests itself. A fighter pilot doesn't deliberate - they recognize the geometry and their hands move.

**This is the goal state: orientation so developed that IG&C handles routine situations.** Explicit decide loops are reserved for genuinely novel circumstances. Every decision that becomes automatic (codified in orientation) is removed from the critical path.

**The F-86 vs. MiG-15 Analysis in Detail**

Boyd's original analysis of Korean War air combat went far beyond simple observation superiority. He identified a constellation of factors:

**Observation advantages:**
- Bubble canopy provided continuous situational awareness
- Pilot could track multiple contacts and environmental conditions simultaneously
- No blind spots meant no surprises from unobserved angles

**Orientation advantages:**
- American pilots had more hours in their specific aircraft type
- F-86 handling characteristics were more intuitive (hydraulic controls matched pilot intention with aircraft response)
- Training doctrine emphasized energy management and situational awareness

**Decide/Act advantages:**
- Hydraulic controls meant no lag between decision and aircraft response
- At high speed, MiG pilots had to fight their control surfaces; F-86 pilots did not
- Transition cost from decision to action was near-zero

The kill ratio wasn't about superior flying skill in some abstract sense. It was about **system-level OODA cycle time.** Every component of the F-86 system (aircraft design, training doctrine, control ergonomics) contributed to faster cycling. The MiG-15's performance advantages were negated because Soviet pilots couldn't exploit them - they were perpetually one OODA cycle behind.

This illustrates a key principle: **the OODA framework applies to systems, not individuals.** The F-86's bubble canopy is meaningless without a pilot trained to exploit it. The pilot's skill is meaningless without an aircraft designed to translate decisions into action. The entire human-machine system cycles together.

**Incestuous Amplification: A Theory of Organizational Pathology**

Boyd's warning about incestuous amplification describes a failure mode where orientation corrupts observation in a self-reinforcing cycle:

1. Orientation creates expectations about what will be observed
2. Observations matching expectations are noticed and amplified
3. Observations contradicting expectations are filtered, dismissed, or reinterpreted
4. The orientation is reinforced, not corrected
5. The next cycle has even stronger filtering

**Intelligence community example:** Agency analysts develop a model of enemy intentions. Evidence confirming the model is reported up the chain. Evidence contradicting the model is questioned ("is this source reliable?"), requires additional verification, or is dismissed as deception. Leadership receives filtered information that confirms their orientation, which influences what intelligence is prioritized, which further biases collection.

This isn't stupidity or corruption - it's a structural feature of how human cognition interacts with hierarchical information processing. Each node in the hierarchy filters observations through its orientation before passing them on.

**Vietnam War strategic failure:** The American orientation was that conventional military force could win a fundamentally political conflict. Observations were systematically interpreted through this orientation:
- Enemy casualties were "progress" (they were actually acceptable losses for a protracted struggle)
- Territory held was "progress" (meaningless in guerrilla warfare)
- Enemy offensives were "desperation" (they were demonstrations of capability)

The orientation was wrong at the structural level. No amount of additional observation could correct it because observations were filtered through the wrong interpretive framework. The solution wasn't better intelligence - it was destruction of the underlying mental model.

**Counter-measure:** Boyd advocated deliberately seeking disconfirming evidence. Before acting on any analysis, ask: "What would I observe if this analysis is wrong?" This forces the synthesis mechanism to generate alternatives rather than confirm priors.

**The Four Organizational Qualities**

In "Organic Design for Command and Control" (1987), Boyd identified four German military concepts that enable organizational agility:

**Fingerspitzengefuhl** (fingertip feel): Intuitive understanding that emerges from deep experience. The expert practitioner doesn't analyze - they perceive the situation directly. This is the psychological correlate of IG&C: orientation so developed that correct action emerges without deliberation.

Development of Fingerspitzengefuhl requires extensive pattern exposure under conditions allowing feedback. Simulation, case studies, repetitive practice - anything that builds the pattern library that enables recognition-primed decision-making.

**Einheit** (unity, oneness): Shared mental models across an organization. When everyone has the same orientation, they can predict each other's actions without explicit communication. Coordination emerges implicitly from shared understanding.

This explains why documentation matters more than orchestration. A shared CLAUDE.md (cultural traditions) creates Einheit - agents can coordinate implicitly because they predict each other's behavior from common orientation. Without Einheit, every action requires explicit coordination, creating bottlenecks and latency.

**Schwerpunkt** (focal point, center of gravity): Clear prioritization of effort. In the presence of competing objectives, orientation fragments. Agents optimize for different goals, coordination breaks down, and the system loses coherence.

Schwerpunkt must be communicated clearly and accepted throughout the organization. It shapes orientation: when priorities conflict, everyone knows which one wins without asking. This enables Auftragstaktik.

**Auftragstaktik** (mission-type tactics): Communicate intent, not method. The subordinate has better local observation than the commander. Dictating specific actions means the actor can't adapt to local conditions.

The commander provides orientation (intent, priorities, constraints). The subordinate performs local observation and decides/acts based on the combination of communicated orientation and local observation. This leverages distributed observation capability while maintaining coherent purpose.

**These four qualities are mutually enabling:**
- Fingerspitzengefuhl enables rapid Orient → Act (IG&C)
- Einheit enables implicit coordination without communication overhead
- Schwerpunkt prevents orientation fragmentation
- Auftragstaktik leverages distributed observation while maintaining coherent purpose

An organization with all four can cycle OODA at the tactical edge while maintaining strategic coherence. An organization lacking them must centralize decisions, creating bottlenecks that slow cycle time.

**Multi-Agent Implications**

Boyd's framework illuminates multi-agent system design:

**Centralized orchestration failure mode:** A central coordinator observes all agent states, orients to the global picture, decides on actions, and directs each agent. This creates a fundamental bottleneck - the coordinator's OODA cycle governs the entire system. As agent count increases, the coordinator's observe and orient phases become increasingly expensive, cycle time degrades, and the system loses adaptability.

**Boyd-informed alternative:** Establish Einheit through shared cultural traditions (common documentation, consistent conventions, shared mental models). Each agent observes locally, orients through the combination of local observation and shared orientation, and acts. Coordination emerges implicitly because agents predict each other's behavior from shared mental models.

This scales because **communication overhead doesn't grow with agent count.** Agents don't need to coordinate explicitly - they coordinate through shared orientation. The system's OODA cycle time is the individual agent's cycle time, not the coordinator's.

The cost is that Einheit must be actively maintained. As agents specialize or documentation drifts, shared orientation degrades. Coordination failures emerge not because agents are making bad decisions but because they're making good decisions from incompatible orientations.

**Tempo and Task Granularity**

Boyd distinguished tempo (rhythm, cadence) from speed (raw velocity). The goal isn't maximum velocity - it's controlled rhythm that maintains adaptability.

For agent systems, tempo manifests as task granularity:

| Task Characteristic | OODA Implication |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Task exceeds context window | Cycle cannot complete; orientation is destroyed mid-cycle |
| Task requires extensive observation before orientation | Long latency before any action; vulnerable to environment changes |
| Task is too small | Overhead dominates; coherent orientation cannot develop |
| Task aligns with natural OODA cycle | Sustainable tempo; can re-orient if initial orientation was wrong |

The "autocompact problem" (context window overflow forcing state reset) is a tempo disruption. The agent is mid-cycle - perhaps through observe and partway through orient - when orientation is destroyed. The next cycle must rebuild from scratch, losing all accumulated understanding.

**Task boundaries should align with complete OODA loops.** A well-designed task:
1. Provides sufficient context to establish initial orientation
2. Allows complete observation of the relevant problem space
3. Enables explicit or implicit decision
4. Permits action and observation of results
5. Produces output that enables the next cycle to orient faster

**Orientation as the System Bottleneck**

For contemporary agent systems:

| Phase | Typical Performance | Bottleneck? |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| Observe | Near-instant (parallel file reads, grep) | No |
| Orient | Variable, often slow (synthesis, disambiguation, model building) | **Yes** |
| Decide | Fast once orientation is solid | No |
| Act | Mechanical (code generation, file writes) | No |

**Observation is essentially solved** - agents can grep codebases in milliseconds, read dozens of files in parallel. The constraint isn't information access.

**Orientation is where agents struggle:**
- Multiple valid patterns in codebase (which is canonical?)
- Implicit conventions not documented
- Ambiguous intent in task descriptions
- Contradictory information requiring reconciliation
- Missing context explaining why apparently wrong patterns exist

A common failure mode: agents observe extensively, reading many files and running many searches, then produce wrong output. They observed plenty but **failed to orient correctly.** More observation wouldn't help - the synthesis mechanism failed.

**Diagnostic implication:** When agents fail, check orientation before adding observations. Ask: "What mental model is the agent working from? Is that model correct?" If the model is wrong, more files won't help. Questioning assumptions helps.

**Failure Mode Taxonomy**

Boyd's framework provides a diagnostic taxonomy:

| Symptom | Apparent Problem | Actual Root Cause |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| "Can't decide what to do" | Decision paralysis | Orient hasn't generated viable options |
| "Keeps trying same failed approach" | Stubbornness | Incestuous amplification - orientation locked into wrong model |
| "Made confidently wrong choice" | Bad judgment | Orient generated wrong option space; never considered correct option |
| "Tried everything, nothing works" | Intractable problem | Orient framed problem incorrectly; correct approach outside frame |
| "Gathering more and more data" | Thoroughness | Synthesis mechanism failing; more inputs won't help |
| "Acting erratically" | Poor quality | Orientation-hostile environment; conflicting signals prevent stable orientation |

**In every case, the intervention is at Orient, not Decide or Act.** Decision-making techniques won't help if the decision space is wrong. Execution improvements won't help if the wrong action is being executed. The leverage is in orientation.

**System Design Implications**

Boyd's framework suggests specific design priorities:

**1. Invest in orientation infrastructure (highest leverage)**
- Comprehensive documentation that accelerates pattern recognition
- Architecture decision records explaining *why*, not just *what*
- Examples and counter-examples that calibrate mental models
- Explicit documentation of conventions (making cultural traditions transmissible)

**2. Design for Einheit (enables implicit coordination)**
- Common documentation across agents
- Consistent patterns within codebases
- Clear schwerpunkt (priorities) that resolve conflicts without communication
- Shared mental models that enable prediction without coordination

**3. Develop IG&C capacity (removes decisions from critical path)**
- Track which decisions repeat across tasks
- Convert repeated decisions into explicit conventions
- Provide examples so thorough that "just knowing" becomes possible
- Goal: explicit decide cycles only for genuinely novel situations

**4. Counter incestuous amplification (prevents orientation lock-in)**
- Explicit instruction to seek disconfirming evidence
- Require identification of what would falsify current hypothesis
- Pattern: "Before implementing, find code that contradicts your assumption"
- Rotate perspectives to prevent single-orientation dominance

**5. Align task boundaries with OODA cycles (maintains tempo)**
- Size tasks to complete within resource constraints
- Avoid context resets mid-cycle
- Design handoffs to preserve orientation
- Task output should accelerate next task's orientation

**Theoretical Implications**

Boyd's framework has implications beyond tactical application:

**Strategy as tempo control:** Strategic advantage comes not from superior position but from superior cycling speed. The strategist who can orient to environmental changes faster than competitors can seize emerging opportunities before competitors recognize them.

**Learning as orientation refinement:** Effective learning isn't information accumulation - it's orientation improvement. The question isn't "what do you know?" but "how good are your mental models?" A learner with fewer facts but better models outperforms one with more facts but broken models.

**Coordination without communication:** Einheit demonstrates that coordination doesn't require communication. If agents share orientation, they can predict each other's behavior and deconflict implicitly. Communication is overhead - necessary when orientation is not shared, expensive always.

**The limits of observation:** More data doesn't help if the interpretation framework is wrong. Organizations investing heavily in observation (data collection, monitoring, intelligence) while neglecting orientation (analysis, synthesis, model building) will develop sophisticated wrong answers.

**Adaptability as meta-competence:** The ability to destroy inadequate mental models and construct better ones is the fundamental competence underlying all others. A rigid orientation eventually fails as the environment changes; a flexible orientation adapts.

**Conclusion: Orientation as the Lever**

Boyd's OODA framework reveals **orientation as the highest-leverage intervention point.** Systems that optimize observation (faster tools, more data) without improving orientation hit diminishing returns. Systems that optimize decision-making (better algorithms, more options) fail if orientation is wrong. Systems that optimize action (faster execution, better tools) are irrelevant if executing wrong actions.

The hierarchy of investment:
1. Orient correctly
2. Then observe efficiently
3. Then decide effectively
4. Then act precisely

Getting this order wrong is expensive. Perfect observation feeding wrong orientation produces confidently wrong action. Sophisticated decision-making over a wrong option space selects the best wrong answer. Flawless execution of the wrong action makes things worse faster.

Boyd's insight, derived from fighter combat but applicable wherever agents compete or cooperate: **the battle is won in orientation.** Everything else is downstream.
