# Situational Leadership Model

**Source:** Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard - Situational Leadership Theory

## Framework Summary

Leadership style should adapt to follower readiness/development level. No single "best" style exists - effective leadership matches approach to the situation.

## Key Concepts

### Four Leadership Styles (S1-S4)

| Style | Directive | Supportive | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **S1 Telling/Directing** | High | Low | Follower can't and won't |
| **S2 Selling/Coaching** | High | High | Follower can't but will |
| **S3 Participating/Supporting** | Low | High | Follower can but won't |
| **S4 Delegating** | Low | Low | Follower can and will |

### Four Development Levels (D1-D4)

- **D1 Enthusiastic Beginner**: Low competence, high commitment
- **D2 Disillusioned Learner**: Some competence, low commitment (the "valley")
- **D3 Capable but Cautious**: Moderate-high competence, variable commitment
- **D4 Self-Reliant Achiever**: High competence, high commitment

### The Matching Principle

Style should match development level: D1→S1, D2→S2, D3→S3, D4→S4

## Agent Application

### What Doesn't Translate

**The "Selling" style (S2) doesn't translate** - Agents don't need motivation or buy-in. They don't have commitment issues in the human sense.

**"Participating" (S3) transforms** - The issue becomes unclear requirements, not agent confidence.

### Simplified Three-Style Model for Agents

| Style | When | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **DIRECT** | Novel tasks, high-risk, unproven capability | Explicit step-by-step instructions, verify each step |
| **EXPLORE** | Unclear requirements | Collaborative discovery before action |
| **DELEGATE** | Proven patterns, clear specs, low stakes | State goal, let agent execute |

### Development Level → Task Characteristics

Agent capability doesn't persist across sessions. Instead, track task characteristics:

- **Task novelty**: First time vs. proven pattern
- **Risk level**: Reversible vs. high stakes
- **Specification clarity**: Clear criteria vs. vague requirements
- **Context availability**: CLAUDE.md coverage for this domain

## Practical Implications

1. **Use DIRECT for**:
   - Novel tasks (first time doing X)
   - High-risk situations (production changes)
   - Unproven capability (new domain)

2. **Use EXPLORE when**:
   - Requirements are unclear
   - Multiple valid approaches exist
   - Need to discover before acting

3. **Use DELEGATE for**:
   - Proven patterns (done this successfully before)
   - Clear specifications (unambiguous success criteria)
   - Low stakes (easily reversible)

4. **Track task types** - Know when delegation is earned through successful execution history

5. **Encode proven capabilities** - CLAUDE.md should capture what the agent has demonstrated competence in

## Key Insight

The meta-skill is situation assessment: explicitly choosing supervision style based on task characteristics rather than defaulting to a preferred style. Most supervision failures come from style mismatch - delegating high-risk novel tasks, or micromanaging proven patterns.
