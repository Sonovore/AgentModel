## Critical Issues for Book Publication

### 1. Missing ISBNs in Book Citations

**Current state:** Only 4 citations include ISBN or DOI identifiers out of 1,407 sources.

### 2. Missing DOIs in Academic Papers

Most academic papers lack DOI identifiers, which are standard for modern academic citation.

**Papers that need DOI verification:**
- Buck, D. A., Trainor, J. E., & Aguirre, B. E. (2006). A Critical Evaluation of the Incident Command System and NIMS. Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
- Dwork, C., Lynch, N., & Stockmeyer, L. (1988). Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony. Journal of the ACM.
- Fischer, M.J., Lynch, N.A., & Paterson, M.S. (1985). "Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process." Journal of the ACM.
- Jensen, M. C., & Meckling, W. H. (1976). "Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure." Journal of Financial Economics, 3(4), 305-360.
- Klimoski, R., & Mohammed, S. (1994). Team mental model: Construct or metaphor? Journal of Management, 20(2), 403-427.
- Moynihan, D. P. (2009). The Network Governance of Crisis Response: Case Studies of Incident Command Systems. Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory.
- Simon, Herbert A. "A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice." Quarterly Journal of Economics 69, no. 1 (1955): 99-118.
- Vickrey, W. (1961). Counterspeculation, Auctions, and Competitive Sealed Tenders. Journal of Finance.

**Recommendation:** Add DOIs to academic papers where available. Use CrossRef or Google Scholar to find DOIs.

### 3. "Other" Category Needs Review

266 sources are categorized as "Other" - these need manual review to properly categorize or improve citation format.

**Examples from "Other" category:**
- ADP 6-0 Mission Command, U.S. Army
- Air Force Doctrine Publication 3-0.1, Command and Control (January 2025)
- Air Force Doctrine Publication 5-0: Planning
- Citino, Robert. "The German Way of War" (2005) - Prussian military culture
- Coram, Robert. "Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War." Back Bay Books, 2002. ISBN 978-0316796880.
- F-86 vs. MiG-15 performance data from official USAF historical studies
- Gigerenzer, Gerd, and Peter M. Todd. Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart. Oxford University Press, 1999.
- Hammond, Grant. "The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security" (2001)
- Internal research documents in this repository
- Joint Publication 3-0 Joint Operations
- Mission Command philosophy
- NATO Command and Control documentation
- Observer Pattern in software architecture
- OODA Loop (Boyd) - RPD maps to Orient and the IG&C fast path

**Recommendation:** Review and recategorize. Many appear to be military doctrine (should be moved to that category) or books (need ISBN and proper formatting).

---

### 4. Inconsistent Author Name Formatting

**Issue:** Some citations use "Last, First" format, others use "First Last" format.

**Examples of inconsistency:**
- "Coram, Robert" (good)
- "Robert Coram" (inconsistent)
- "Hammond, Grant T." (good)
- "Grant Hammond" (inconsistent)

**Recommendation:** Standardize to "Last, First" format for all authors (standard academic style).

---

### 5. Military Doctrine Citations Need Verification

Many military doctrine citations lack proper identifying information:
- Edition/version numbers
- Publication dates
- Document control numbers
- Official URLs

**Examples needing completion:**
- "ADP 6-0 Mission Command, U.S. Army" (needs date, edition)
- "Joint Publication 3-0 Joint Operations" (needs date)
- "FM 5-0 (Army Planning and Orders Production)" (needs full date, edition)

**Recommendation:** Add complete publication information for all military doctrine citations.

---

### 6. Website URLs Need "Accessed" Dates

For book publication, website citations should include access dates.

**Current format:**
- [Link Title](URL)

**Recommended format for book:**
- Author (if available). "Title." Website Name. URL. Accessed YYYY-MM-DD.

**Recommendation:** Add access dates to all website citations. Since this was generated on 2026-01-20, all sources should be marked as accessed on or before this date.

## Recommended Action Plan

### For Book Publication Preparation:

1. **High Priority (Critical):**
   - Add ISBNs to all 50+ book citations
   - Add DOIs to all academic paper citations
   - Verify and complete all military doctrine citations
   - Standardize author name formatting

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Review and recategorize 266 "Other" citations
   - Add access dates to all website citations
   - Review 26 documents without sources sections

3. **Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
   - Consider replacing Wikipedia citations with primary sources
   - Verify all URLs are still active
   - Consider adding page numbers for book citations (especially if specific pages were referenced)

## Automation Script

The extraction script is located at:
- `.claude/scripts/extract_sources.py`

To regenerate the bibliography after making corrections:
```bash
cd /Users/chrishector/SonovoreDrive/Sonovore/AgentModel
python3 .claude/scripts/extract_sources.py
```

This will recreate both:
- `docs/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md`
- `docs/CITATION-INDEX.md`

## Notes for Future Maintenance

1. **When adding new research documents:** Include a "Sources" or "References" section at the end with citations formatted as markdown list items (starting with `-`)

2. **Citation format preference:**
   - Books: Author. *Title*. Publisher, Year. ISBN XXX.
   - Papers: Author. "Title." *Journal*, Volume(Issue), Pages. DOI: XXX.
   - Websites: [Title](URL) with access date noted
   - Military: Publication Number Title, Edition, Date

3. **The script automatically:**
   - Deduplicates sources based on URL or title
   - Categorizes sources by type
   - Creates cross-reference index
   - Alphabetizes within categories

4. **Manual review required for:**
   - ISBN/DOI addition
   - Author name standardization
   - Categorization of "Other" items
   - Access date addition
