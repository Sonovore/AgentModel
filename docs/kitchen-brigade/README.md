# Kitchen Brigade

Mental models from kitchen brigade organization applied to AI agent station-based specialization, hierarchical coordination, and service synchronization.

## Purpose

The kitchen brigade (brigade de cuisine) system demonstrates scalable hierarchical organization with clear specialization, well-defined roles, and precise coordination under time pressure. Each station has autonomy over its domain while maintaining strict synchronization with other stations. The system inspired military and industrial organization, and its principles apply directly to how AI agent specialists can coordinate without constant top-level direction.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Specialization and Organization

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Station-Based Specialization | Brigade de cuisine | Each agent/station owns a domain of expertise |
| Executive Chef Authority | Kitchen hierarchy | Clear top authority with specialized staff |
| Sous Chef Model | Kitchen brigade | Senior specialist coordinating peer stations |
| Apprenticeship Structure | Kitchen brigade | Clear progression and training |
| Cross-Station Dependencies | Kitchen operations | Explicit knowledge of what other stations do |

### Hierarchical Communication

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Chain of Command Routing | Kitchen brigade | Messages flow through hierarchy, not laterally |
| Service Calls | Kitchen practice | Senior role calling out timing and readiness |
| Station Readiness Reporting | Kitchen operations | Each station signaling when it can proceed |
| Pass-Through Quality Control | Kitchen brigade | Authority checking work at each station |
| Clear Responsibility | Kitchen hierarchy | No ambiguity about who handles what |

### Service Coordination

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Service Synchronization | Kitchen operations | Coordinating timing so all dishes ready together |
| Plate Rhythm | Kitchen practice | Synchronized pace of delivering plates |
| Sous Vide and Holding | Kitchen technique | Managing agents at different speeds |
| Mise en Place | Culinary practice | Complete preparation before service starts |
| Running the Line | Kitchen operations | Managing real-time coordination during service |

### Communication Discipline

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Call System | Kitchen operations | Announcing status and changes clearly |
| Repeat Back | Service practice | Confirming orders to prevent miscommunication |
| Clear Terminology | Culinary practice | Standardized language across the team |
| Hand Signals and Sight Lines | Kitchen operations | Non-verbal coordination under noise |
| Priority Communication | Kitchen hierarchy | Important messages take precedence |

### Institutional Knowledge

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Recipes as Procedures | Culinary knowledge | Standardized, documented ways of working |
| Quality Standards | Kitchen brigade | Expected outcomes, not prescribed methods |
| Training and Mentorship | Brigade practice | Explicit transfer of knowledge to new members |
| Consistency Over Time | Kitchen operations | Same results whether Chef de Partie works today or tomorrow |

### Modern Adaptation

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Open Kitchen Visibility | Modern restaurant practice | Transparency of operations to observers |
| Kitchen Automation | Contemporary cooking | Combining traditional organization with new tools |
| Flexible Brigades | Modern adaptations | Adjusting organization based on service volume |

## Priority Assessment

| Model | Relevance | Complexity | Suggested Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Station-Based Specialization** | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| **Chain of Command Routing** | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| **Service Coordination** | High | Medium | 1 |
| **Call System** | High | Low | 1 |
| **Executive Chef Authority** | High | Medium | 2 |
| **Sous Chef Model** | High | Medium | 2 |
| **Mise en Place** | High | Low | 2 |
| **Cross-Station Dependencies** | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| **Apprenticeship Structure** | Medium | Medium | 3 |

## Key Questions

1. How do you map "stations" to AI agent specialization domains?
2. What does a "chain of command" for agents look like while maintaining autonomy?
3. How do agents "call" readiness status and coordinate timing?
4. What's the equivalent of "mise en place" - complete preparation before execution?
5. How do you implement the "call system" for computational agents?
6. What standardized "recipes" or procedures should be codified for agents?
7. How do you scale from small brigades to large coordinated kitchens?
