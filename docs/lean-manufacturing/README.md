# Lean Manufacturing

Mental models from Toyota Production System and lean manufacturing applied to AI agent coordination, just-in-time operations, and continuous improvement.

## Purpose

Lean manufacturing demonstrates sustainable multi-agent coordination at scale, with emphasis on flow efficiency, waste reduction, and continuous improvement. The Toyota Production System's principles of just-in-time delivery, jidoka (automation with human touch), and kaizen (continuous improvement) provide patterns for how AI agents can coordinate with each other and with humans while maintaining adaptability and preventing system rigidity.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Flow and Timing

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Just-in-Time Coordination | Toyota Production System | Agents producing exactly what's needed when needed |
| Pull Systems | Lean manufacturing | Downstream agents requesting from upstream agents |
| Flow Efficiency | Lean operations | Optimizing work flow vs individual task speed |
| Kanban Signaling | TPS discipline | Visual signals triggering work rather than schedules |
| Takt Time | Lean operations | Synchronized rhythm matching external demand |

### Automation and Human Collaboration

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Jidoka (Automation with Human Touch) | Toyota philosophy | Combining automation with human judgment |
| Andon Cord | TPS practice | Workers stopping process to address problems |
| Error Proofing (Poka-Yoke) | Lean quality | Designing processes to prevent errors |
| Self-Healing Systems | Lean operations | Systems that detect and correct minor issues |
| Human-Machine Balance | TPS philosophy | Neither pure automation nor pure manual |

### Continuous Improvement

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) | Toyota philosophy | Ongoing incremental improvement everyone participates in |
| Problem-First Approach | TPS discipline | Identifying and prioritizing problems before solutions |
| Root Cause Analysis | Lean practice | Understanding problems deeply before responding |
| Improvement Cycles | Kaizen | Systematic steps for testing and implementing changes |
| Learning Orientation | TPS culture | Viewing problems as learning opportunities |

### Visual Management and Transparency

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Visual Management | Lean operations | Making system state visible to all participants |
| Gemba Walking | TPS practice | Leaders observing actual work to understand system |
| Transparency Discipline | Lean operations | Open visibility of problems and performance |
| Status Boards | Lean communication | Shared awareness of work and metrics |
| Metrics That Matter | Lean operations | Focusing on indicators that reflect system health |

### Organizational Autonomy

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Regional Autonomy Within Global Framework | Toyota structure | Local decision-making within global standards |
| Empowered Teams | Lean operations | Agents/teams making decisions about their work |
| Standards as Enabling | TPS philosophy | Standards as foundation for improvement, not constraints |
| Decentralized Problem-Solving | Lean practice | Teams solving problems at the level they occur |
| Respect for People | Toyota philosophy | Trusting workers/agents to improve their own work |

## Key Questions

1. How do "pull systems" translate to AI agent coordination - what triggers work?
2. What does "just-in-time" look like for computational agents?
3. How do you balance automation (efficiency) with human touch (adaptability)?
4. What's the agent equivalent of "takt time" - synchronized rhythm?
5. How do you implement "visual management" of agent system state?
6. What "kaizen" processes make sense for continuously improving agent coordination?
7. How do you maintain "regional autonomy" while ensuring global coherence?
