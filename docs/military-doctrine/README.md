# Military Doctrine

Mental models from military strategic and operational theory applied to AI agent system design.

## Purpose

Military doctrine represents centuries of accumulated wisdom about operating under uncertainty, managing complexity, and achieving objectives despite opposition. These principles inform the design of robust agent systems.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Principles of War

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Mass | Principles of war | Concentrate resources at decisive point |
| Economy of Force | Principles of war | Minimum resources for secondary objectives |
| Maneuver | Principles of war | Position for advantage |
| Unity of Command | Principles of war | One responsible commander |
| Security | Principles of war | Protect against surprise |
| Surprise | Principles of war | Strike where/when unexpected |
| Simplicity | Principles of war | Clear, uncomplicated plans |
| Objective | Principles of war | Clear, decisive, attainable goals |

### Operational Art

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Center of Gravity | Clausewitz | Source of power that enables action |
| Culminating Point | Clausewitz | When offensive strength is exhausted |
| Lines of Operation | Operational art | Connected actions toward objectives |
| Decisive Points | Operational art | Keys to center of gravity |
| Operational Reach | Doctrine | How far you can sustain operations |
| Tempo | Doctrine | Speed of operations relative to opponent |

### Strategic Theory

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Ends-Ways-Means | Strategy | Goals, methods, resources alignment |
| Friction | Clausewitz | Resistance of reality to plans |
| Fog of War | Clausewitz | Uncertainty in operations |
| Culmination | Clausewitz | Point of overextension |
| Schwerpunkt | German doctrine | Point of main effort (focal point) |

### Maneuver Warfare

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Surfaces and Gaps | Maneuver theory | Avoid strength, exploit weakness |
| Recon Pull | Maneuver theory | Let reconnaissance guide movement |
| Combined Arms | Doctrine | Integrate different capabilities |
| Exploitation and Pursuit | Doctrine | Following up on success |
| Reserve | Doctrine | Uncommitted force for opportunity |

### Asymmetric and Irregular

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Guerrilla Principles | Mao, etc. | Operating with inferior resources |
| COIN Principles | Counterinsurgency | Operating among populations |
| 4th Generation Warfare | Lind et al. | Decentralized, networked conflict |

## Priority Assessment

| Model | Relevance | Complexity | Suggested Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Friction / Fog of War | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| Ends-Ways-Means | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| Mass / Economy of Force | High | Low | 1 |
| Schwerpunkt (Main Effort) | High | Medium | 1 |
| Center of Gravity | High | High | 2 |
| Tempo | High | Medium | 2 |
| Surfaces and Gaps | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| Culminating Point | Medium | Medium | 3 |

## Key Questions

1. What's "friction" in agent systems? (Gap between plan and reality)
2. What's the "fog of war" for human-agent teams? (What we don't know)
3. How do you identify "center of gravity" for a problem domain?
4. What's "tempo" for agent operations? (Speed of iteration)
5. How do you maintain a "reserve" in agent systems? (Uncommitted capacity)
6. What's "culmination" - when does an agent approach exhaust its effectiveness?
