# Theater Stage Management

Mental models from theater stage management applied to AI agent production coordination and real-time execution.

## Purpose

Theater stage management provides a proven system for coordinating complex, time-sensitive multi-agent operations with precise cue-based transitions. Stage managers maintain consistency between planning and execution, manage contingencies, and keep all agents synchronized to a master timeline. These patterns directly address real-time AI agent orchestration challenges.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Cue Systems and Sequencing

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Cue-Based Coordination | Stage management | Precise triggering of coordinated state changes |
| Master Cuelist | Production practice | Single source of truth for sequencing |
| Standby and Go | Cue system | Two-stage commitment to action |
| Cue Numbering System | Stage management | Hierarchical sequencing (1.0, 1.1, 1.2) |
| Cue Sheets | Documentation | Complete record of state transitions |

### Operational Modes

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Rehearsal vs Performance Modes | Theater practice | Different operating modes with different constraints |
| Tech Rehearsal | Production process | Validation before live operation |
| Quick Study Protocols | Production practice | Contingency readiness without full rehearsal |
| Running the Show | Stage management | Executing predetermined sequence with minimal intervention |

### Communication Hub

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Central Communication Hub | Stage management | Single point coordinating all agent actions |
| Headset Network | Production practice | Always-on communication across distributed agents |
| Go/Standby Protocol | Stage practice | Pre-action alerting before execution |
| Props and Handoffs | Stage management | Explicit state transfer between agents |
| Timing Reports | Stage practice | Shared time synchronization |

### Contingency and Adaptation

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Contingency Planning | Stage management | Predetermined responses to expected failures |
| Ad-Lib Protocols | Theater practice | Improvisation within structured framework |
| Show Adjustments | Production practice | Real-time modifications without stopping |
| Safety Pauses | Stage management | Emergency stop procedures |
| Debrief and Adjustment | Production practice | Post-execution analysis and tuning |

### Documentation Discipline

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Cuebook Standards | Stage management | Complete, auditable record of all actions |
| Strike Procedures | Stage practice | Defined sequence for shutdown/reset |
| Crew Manifests | Production management | Clear assignment of responsibilities |
| Change Logs | Stage management | Tracking modifications to sequences |

## Priority Assessment

| Model | Relevance | Complexity | Suggested Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Cue-Based Coordination** | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| **Master Cuelist** | Very High | Low | 1 - Critical |
| **Central Communication Hub** | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| **Rehearsal vs Performance Modes** | High | Low | 1 |
| **Contingency Planning** | High | High | 2 |
| **Documentation Discipline** | High | Low | 2 |
| **Standby and Go Protocol** | High | Low | 2 |
| **Go/Standby Protocol** | Medium | Low | 3 |
| **Quick Study Protocols** | Medium | Medium | 3 |

## Key Questions

1. How do you translate "cues" to AI agents - what triggers state changes?
2. What should a master cuelist look like for complex agent workflows?
3. How do stage management communication patterns apply to API-based agent systems?
4. What does "rehearsal mode" provide that "performance mode" doesn't for agents?
5. What contingencies are most critical to pre-plan for multi-agent systems?
6. How do you maintain an auditable record of all agent state transitions?
