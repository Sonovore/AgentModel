# Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR)

## Application to Human Supervision of AI Agent Systems

*Research document exploring military doctrine on information requirements for adaptation to agent orchestration*

---

## Executive Summary

Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR) represent a doctrine-tested framework for managing information flow in complex, high-stakes operations. In military command, the fundamental challenge mirrors what we face in agent supervision: an overwhelming volume of information must be filtered to the critical few items that demand immediate human attention and decision-making.

This document examines CCIR doctrine in depth, exploring its components, development process, and integration with battle rhythm, with the goal of extracting principles applicable to human oversight of autonomous agent systems.

## Part I: Doctrinal Foundation

### Definition and Purpose

The Department of Defense defines Commander's Critical Information Requirements as "a comprehensive list of information requirements identified by the commander as being critical in facilitating timely information management and the decision making process that affect successful mission accomplishment."

The key insight is in the word "critical" - CCIR functions as a focusing lens that reduces the abundance of available information to only that which is essential for timely and accurate decisions. Without such filtering, commanders face what doctrine calls "information overload" - a state where the sheer volume of data obscures rather than illuminates the operational picture.

As the Center for Army Lessons Learned has observed: "Staffs often present raw, unrefined data without analysis and are unable to provide the knowledge commanders need to make decisions." CCIR addresses this by defining in advance exactly what information the commander needs, when they need it, and what form it should take.

### The Two Components: PIR and FFIR

CCIR consists of two primary doctrinal components, each serving a distinct purpose:

#### Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR)

PIR focuses on the enemy and the operational environment. It represents what the commander needs to know about external threats and conditions to make decisions. PIR is best defined as "information requirements pertaining to the enemy or operational environment, deemed critical to either (1) reaching a commander's decision point or (2) achieving a specific desired effect."

Key characteristics of effective PIR:
- **Single-focus**: Each PIR asks only one question about a specific fact, event, or activity
- **Decision-linked**: Provides intelligence required to support a single decision
- **Collection-oriented**: Serves as the means by which the commander tasks Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets
- **Specific with indicators**: Includes parameters for reporting (e.g., "location of a company of T-90s with indicators for collector parameters")

PIR examples might include:
- Location of enemy reserve forces
- Enemy task organization and attrition levels
- Status of high-priority targets
- Adversary decision points and likely responses

#### Friendly Force Information Requirements (FFIR)

FFIR pertains to the status and capabilities of friendly forces. It represents what the commander needs to know about their own assets to effectively manage resources and execute the mission. FFIR is defined as "information the commander and staff need to understand the status of friendly force and supporting capabilities."

FFIR focuses on:
- Unit readiness and combat power
- Critical system status
- Logistics and sustainment status
- Position and disposition of forces
- Loss of key capabilities

The distinction is functional: **if a decision is triggered by enemy status, the CCIR is a PIR; if triggered by friendly status, it's an FFIR.**

### Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI)

While not doctrinally part of CCIR, EEFI is closely related. EEFI represents "the critical aspects of a friendly operation that, if known by the enemy, would subsequently compromise, lead to failure, or limit success of the operation."

EEFI is essentially the inverse of CCIR - rather than what the commander needs to know, it's what the commander needs to *hide*. This includes:
- Battle plans and operational timelines
- Signal Operating Instructions (SOI)
- Troop strength, movements, and positions
- Location of command, control, and communications nodes
- Critical vulnerabilities

EEFI is derived during wargaming when the staff identifies information that would give the adversary an advantage if compromised. The S2 Intelligence Officer typically recommends EEFI to the commander through the course of action analysis process.

## Part II: CCIR Development During Planning

### Integration with the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP)

CCIR development is woven throughout the planning process, evolving as the operation concept matures:

**During Mission Analysis**: Initial CCIRs focus on decisions the commander must make to guide planning. These are broad requirements about the operational environment, enemy capabilities, and friendly force status needed to develop viable courses of action.

**During COA Development and Analysis**: As the staff wargames courses of action, they identify the specific conditions that would trigger transitions between phases, commitment of reserves, or execution of branch plans. These conditions become more refined CCIRs.

**After COA Selection**: Once the commander selects a course of action, CCIRs shift to information needed for decisions during preparation and execution. They become tightly linked to specific decision points and triggering conditions.

### The Decision Point Linkage

The critical insight in CCIR doctrine is that information requirements exist to support decisions. Every CCIR should trace back to a specific decision the commander will need to make. This linkage creates accountability and prevents "nice to know" information from crowding out "need to know."

The relationship works as follows:
1. **Decision Points (DPs)** are identified during planning - moments when the commander must choose between courses of action or adjust the plan
2. **CCIRs** define the information needed to make those decisions
3. **Named Areas of Interest (NAIs)** are locations where collection assets focus to answer PIRs
4. **Decision Support Templates (DSTs)** graphically depict when and where specific actions should occur
5. **Decision Support Matrices (DSMs)** provide written criteria for decisions

A robust planning process asks: "What decision will the commander need to make? What information triggers that decision? Where and how do we collect that information?"

### Wargaming and Branch Plans

During wargaming, staff "fight" each course of action against likely enemy responses. This reveals:
- **Branches**: Contingency options for unexpected enemy actions or friendly shortfalls
- **Sequels**: Follow-on missions such as exploitation or pursuit
- **Decision Points**: Specific triggers where the commander must choose

Both branches and sequels require unique operational conditions - answered by PIR and FFIR - that must be met to reach the decision point. For example:
- "If enemy reserve is uncommitted by H+4 (PIR), execute Branch A"
- "If lead battalion falls below 70% combat power (FFIR), commit reserve"

The Decision Support Matrix specifies: "When this condition is met (CCIR answered), the commander decides whether to execute this action."

## Part III: Information Filtering and the Battle Rhythm

### The Filtering Problem

Combat generates massive amounts of information. Every sensor, every patrol, every logistics report produces data. The challenge is reducing this torrent to the critical few items that demand commander attention.

Doctrine acknowledges this directly: "The increased range and lethality of weapons systems, faster tempo, shorter decision cycles, and extended battlespace all serve to increase confusion and the volume of information. The key to achieving situational understanding and avoiding information overload is identifying relevant information and filtering out distractions."

The solution has two elements:
1. **Pre-defined requirements (CCIR)** that tell everyone what matters
2. **Staff processes (Battle Rhythm)** that filter, analyze, and present information

### Battle Rhythm: The Filtering Mechanism

Battle rhythm is "a deliberate daily cycle of command, staff, and unit activities intended to synchronize current and future operations." It provides the structured process through which raw information becomes actionable intelligence.

Key elements:

**Boards, Working Groups, and Planning Teams**: These cross-functional bodies filter and analyze information before it reaches the commander. A Cross-Functional Event (CFE) brings together representatives from multiple staff sections to build shared understanding.

**The Battle Captain Role**: The battle captain analyzes new information as it enters the command post and routes it appropriately. Crucially, "the battle captain knows the commander's critical information requirements and understands the criteria and triggers for the commander's decision points." This person serves as the primary filter, accepting "the burden of filtering and redistributing information so that every other member of the command post does not need to try to do the same."

**Three Event Horizons**: Staff work spans current operations (execution), future operations (next 24-72 hours), and future plans (beyond 72 hours). Different information flows to different horizons.

### What Reaches the Commander

Not everything reaches the commander, and that's by design. Information is filtered at multiple levels:

**Immediate escalation**: CCIR-triggering information goes immediately to the commander. This is non-negotiable - if information answers a CCIR, it goes up without delay.

**Serious Incident Reports (SIRs)**: Certain events warrant immediate notification regardless of CCIR status. Category 1 incidents are "serious incidents which, in the opinion of the commander, are of immediate concern." These bypass normal filtering.

**Staff-analyzed products**: Most information reaches the commander through staff products - briefings, updates, and assessments where raw data has been "filtered, correlated, analyzed and integrated."

**Running estimates**: Each staff section maintains a continuous assessment of their functional area. Running estimates provide "accurate, relevant, and timely" information that helps identify opportunities for exploitation.

The fundamental principle: **the commander sees insights, not data**. As one Army official put it: "What we need is data processed to information, but more importantly, insights. Insights for the commander... who can provide analytical expertise using information that is often incomplete, messy, and not easily quantifiable."

### Multi-Stage Alerting

Modern doctrine recognizes that alerts must be graduated. Combat systems use "multi-stage alerting [that] progressively escalates from ambient awareness through focused attention to immediate action." Historical data remains accessible but doesn't clutter current operations.

This "temporal layering prevents information overload while maintaining awareness."

## Part IV: Trigger Conditions and Thresholds

### Defining Trigger Criteria

CCIR without specific triggers are ineffective. The doctrine demands specificity: "PIR that is too general in nature will be easily and routinely overlooked. PIR needs to be specific enough to focus intelligence collection efforts on the objective."

Effective triggers are:
- **Measurable**: Can be objectively evaluated (e.g., "enemy battalion at grid XY123456")
- **Observable**: Collection assets can detect the condition
- **Timely**: Provide enough warning for decision and action
- **Linked**: Connected to a specific decision point

### Examples of Trigger Conditions

**PIR Triggers**:
- "Enemy reserve committed" (triggers decision to execute exploitation)
- "Main supply route interdicted" (triggers switch to alternate route)
- "Enemy air defense system relocated" (triggers re-planned air corridor)

**FFIR Triggers**:
- "Battalion combat power below 70%" (triggers reserve commitment decision)
- "Ammunition basic load below 50%" (triggers emergency resupply)
- "Communications lost with subordinate unit for 30 minutes" (triggers backup plan)

### Threshold-Based Reporting

For FFIR especially, thresholds determine when to report. Not every loss of capability triggers escalation - only when the loss crosses a pre-defined threshold. This prevents over-reporting while ensuring critical degradation is captured.

The Decision Support Matrix captures these: "Once fully developed, the DSM specifies the conditions when and where to conduct specific actions, such as chemical attacks, use of air-defense assets, and commitment of reserve forces."

### Continuous Assessment via Running Estimates

While CCIR focuses on discrete triggers, running estimates provide continuous context. FM 6-0 warns: "Failure to maintain running estimates may lead to errors or omissions that result in flawed plans or bad decisions."

Running estimates serve as "the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander's intent and if planned future operations are supportable."

They are not static documents but evolve as facts and assumptions change. The running estimate "should serve as a holistic assessment of operations by phase/critical event as opposed to a simple presentation of raw data and information."

## Part V: Application to Human Supervision of Agents

### The Parallel Problem

Human supervision of AI agents faces the same fundamental challenge as military command: **too much information, too little time, and decisions that cannot wait**.

An autonomous agent operating on a codebase generates continuous activity - file reads, tool calls, decisions, state changes. Surfacing all of this to the human supervisor would be as counterproductive as routing every sensor feed to the military commander. The human would be overwhelmed, unable to distinguish the critical from the routine.

What the human supervisor needs is a CCIR equivalent: pre-defined information requirements that identify exactly what must be escalated immediately versus what can be handled autonomously.

### Designing Agent CCIRs

Drawing from military doctrine, agent CCIRs should have the following characteristics:

#### 1. Decision-Linked
Every agent CCIR should trace to a decision the human needs to make. Examples:
- "Agent requests permission to execute destructive operation" -> Human decides approve/deny
- "Agent encounters ambiguous instruction" -> Human decides clarification
- "Agent identifies multiple viable approaches" -> Human decides direction

**Anti-pattern**: Surfacing information that doesn't require human decision ("Agent read file X").

#### 2. Two Categories: External and Internal

**External Requirements (analogous to PIR)**:
- Unexpected environment states (production system down, external API unavailable)
- Security-relevant events (credential exposure, unauthorized access attempt)
- Business-critical conditions (data that could affect users, compliance issues)
- Novel situations not covered by existing guidance

**Internal Requirements (analogous to FFIR)**:
- Agent state anomalies (confusion, stuck in loop, resource exhaustion)
- Capability boundaries reached (task requires permissions not granted)
- Confidence thresholds crossed (agent uncertainty exceeds threshold)
- Progress metrics (task taking longer than expected, scope creep detected)

#### 3. Specific and Measurable Triggers

Vague requirements like "notify on important events" are useless. Agent CCIRs need specific triggers:
- "Notify if any file in `/prod/` is modified"
- "Notify if task duration exceeds 10 minutes"
- "Notify if agent uncertainty score drops below 0.7"
- "Notify if agent is about to execute any `rm` command"

#### 4. Graduated Escalation

Not everything is equally urgent. Agent CCIRs should define escalation levels:
- **Blocking**: Stop and wait for human decision (destructive operations, security events)
- **Immediate notification**: Continue but alert human immediately (unexpected state)
- **Batched notification**: Include in next summary (progress updates, non-critical anomalies)
- **Logged only**: Don't notify, but record for potential review (routine operations)

### The Agent Battle Rhythm

Military battle rhythm provides scheduled touchpoints for information flow. The agent equivalent might include:

**Continuous Filtering**: An orchestration layer (analogous to the battle captain) that evaluates all agent activity against CCIRs and routes appropriately.

**Periodic Summaries**: Regular roll-ups of agent activity, analogous to commander update briefs. These provide context without requiring constant human attention.

**Decision Points**: Planned checkpoints where human review is required before proceeding, analogous to phase transitions in military operations.

**Running Estimates**: Continuous assessment of task progress, agent state, and emerging issues - providing the human supervisor with situational awareness without requiring action on every update.

### SIR Equivalents: Serious Agent Incidents

Some events warrant immediate escalation regardless of pre-defined CCIRs. Drawing from military SIRs, agent systems should define categories of serious incidents:

**Category 1 (Immediate)**:
- Security breach or credential exposure
- Data loss or corruption
- Agent attempting operation outside authorized scope
- Unrecoverable error state

**Category 2 (Priority)**:
- Repeated failures on critical path
- Resource consumption anomaly
- External system integration failure
- Ambiguity that blocks progress

### EEFI for Agents: What to Protect

The EEFI concept applies to agents as well - information the agent must protect from exposure:
- API keys and credentials
- Personally identifiable information
- Business-sensitive data
- Security vulnerabilities discovered during operation

Agents should be designed to recognize and protect EEFI, escalating rather than exposing when such information is encountered.

## Part VI: Design Principles for Agent CCIR Systems

### Principle 1: Start with Decisions, Not Information

The military approach starts with: "What decisions will the commander need to make?" Not: "What information might be useful?"

For agent systems, start by defining:
- What decisions require human judgment?
- What are the consequences of deciding incorrectly?
- What information would change the decision?

Then derive CCIRs from these decisions.

### Principle 2: Accept Information Asymmetry

The human supervisor will never have complete information about agent operations. This is intentional, not a failure. The goal is providing sufficient information for effective oversight, not comprehensive visibility.

Military commanders accept this: "Recognizing that operations demand constant decisions and revisions to plans, commanders required situational awareness, yet also had to be prepared to accept risk."

### Principle 3: Define Thresholds Explicitly

Ambiguous thresholds create either over-reporting or under-reporting. Define specific, measurable criteria:
- What percentage of task completion triggers a progress update?
- What error rate triggers escalation?
- What duration constitutes "taking too long"?

### Principle 4: Enable Graduated Response

Multi-stage alerting allows calibrated response:
- Ambient awareness (status available if human checks)
- Focused attention (notification delivered but not blocking)
- Immediate action (blocking until human responds)

### Principle 5: Evolve Requirements Over Time

CCIR is not static. As doctrine notes: "CCIRs usually change from mission-to-mission." As trust builds and patterns emerge:
- Reduce requirements that never trigger meaningful decisions
- Add requirements for newly identified risk categories
- Adjust thresholds based on operational experience

### Principle 6: Separate Collection from Notification

The agent should collect and log everything (enabling later review and audit) while only notifying on CCIR-defined triggers. This parallels the military approach where sensor data is captured comprehensively but filtered before reaching the commander.

## Conclusion: From Battlefield to Agent Supervision

Military CCIR doctrine offers a battle-tested framework for the fundamental challenge of human-AI collaboration: maintaining effective oversight without overwhelming the human with irrelevant information.

The key insights translate directly:
1. **Pre-define what matters** - Don't try to determine criticality in the moment; define requirements in advance
2. **Link to decisions** - Information is only critical if it affects a decision
3. **Distinguish internal from external** - Status of the agent (FFIR) vs. status of the environment (PIR)
4. **Specify triggers** - Vague requirements are useless; concrete thresholds enable action
5. **Graduate escalation** - Not everything is equally urgent
6. **Evolve with experience** - Requirements should adapt as operations mature

The goal is identical: enable the human decision-maker to maintain effective command while delegating execution. CCIR doctrine provides the conceptual vocabulary and proven patterns for achieving this balance.
