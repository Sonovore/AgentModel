# Logistics Supply Chain

Mental models from logistics and supply chain management applied to AI agent network optimization, flow management, and multi-objective coordination.

## Purpose

Logistics and supply chain systems solve complex multi-agent coordination problems at massive scale, with emphasis on network optimization, visibility, and balancing competing objectives. Modern supply chains increasingly use real-time data and AI to predict problems, optimize routing, and coordinate across organizational boundaries. These patterns address how distributed agents can coordinate through shared visibility and predictive models.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.
