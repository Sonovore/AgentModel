# Military Decision Making Process (MDMP)

## Research Document for Application to AI Agent Systems

---

## Overview

The Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) is the United States Army's seven-step analytical planning methodology for tactical and garrison environments. Codified in Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 5-0 and Field Manual (FM) 5-0, MDMP provides a systematic framework for commanders and staffs to analyze missions, develop and compare courses of action, and produce operation plans or orders.

MDMP is designed for battalion-sized units and larger with coordinating staffs. Smaller units use the related but simplified Troop Leading Procedures (TLP). The process dates back to the Revolutionary War, originating from Major General von Steuben's "Estimate of the Situation" prepared for General Washington before the attack on Stony Point.

## The Seven Steps in Detail

### Step 1: Receipt of Mission

**Purpose:** Alert participants to pending planning requirements, establish time allocation, and initiate parallel planning.

**Key Tasks:**
- Alert the staff and key participants
- Gather planning tools (maps, terrain products, higher headquarters orders)
- Update running estimates
- Conduct initial assessment
- Issue commander's initial guidance
- Issue initial Warning Order (WARNO)

**Key Outputs:**
- Commander's initial guidance
- Initial time allocation (applying the 1/3-2/3 rule)
- Warning Order #1

**Commander's Initial Guidance includes:**
- Time allocations for planning phases
- Decision to initiate design methodology or proceed directly to MDMP
- How to abbreviate MDMP if time-constrained
- Coordination requirements and liaison officer exchanges
- Authorized movements and reconnaissance to initiate
- Collaborative planning times and locations
- Initial information requirements

**Failure Modes:**
- Not allocating time immediately, leading to compressed planning cycles downstream
- Failing to issue WARNO, leaving subordinates unable to begin parallel planning
- Incomplete initial assessment that misses critical constraints
- Not establishing clear planning timeline for staff

---

### Step 2: Mission Analysis

**Purpose:** Understand the situation and problem, determine what the command must accomplish, when and where it must be done, and why. This is widely considered the most important step.

**Key Tasks (17 sub-tasks):**
1. Analyze higher headquarters plan or order
2. Perform initial Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB)
3. Determine specified, implied, and essential tasks
4. Review available assets and identify resource shortfalls
5. Determine constraints (limitations on freedom of action)
6. Identify critical facts and develop assumptions
7. Begin risk management
8. Develop initial Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs)
9. Develop initial Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFIs)
10. Develop initial information collection plan
11. Update operational timeline
12. Write restated mission
13. Conduct mission analysis briefing
14. Develop commander's intent
15. Develop planning guidance
16. Issue Warning Order #2
17. Review facts and assumptions

**Task Analysis - Specified, Implied, and Essential Tasks:**
- **Specified Tasks:** Explicitly assigned by higher headquarters
- **Implied Tasks:** Not stated but required for mission accomplishment; derived from detailed analysis of higher order and METT-TC factors
- **Essential Tasks:** Those specified and implied tasks that must be executed to accomplish the mission; always included in unit's mission statement

**METT-TC Analysis:**
- Mission
- Enemy
- Terrain and weather
- Troops and support available
- Time available
- Civil considerations

**Key Outputs:**
- Mission Analysis Briefing
- Restated Mission (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY)
- Initial Commander's Intent (Purpose, Method, End State)
- Commander's Planning Guidance
- Updated IPB products (enemy SITTEMPs, MCOO, HVT list)
- Warning Order #2

**Failure Modes:**
- Incomplete IPB leading to flawed assumptions about enemy capabilities
- Missing implied tasks that become critical gaps during execution
- Poorly developed commander's intent that fails to guide subordinates
- Accepting mission statement without critical analysis
- Failing to identify key assumptions that, if wrong, invalidate the plan
- Not updating running estimates, causing errors to compound

---

### Step 3: Course of Action (COA) Development

**Purpose:** Generate options for analysis and comparison that satisfy commander's intent and planning guidance.

**Key Tasks:**
- Analyze relative combat power
- Generate options
- Array forces
- Develop schemes of maneuver
- Assign headquarters and troops
- Prepare COA statements and sketches

**COA Screening Criteria (SFADC):**
1. **Suitable:** Accomplishes the mission and meets commander's intent
2. **Feasible:** Can be accomplished within time, space, and resource limitations
3. **Acceptable:** Has right balance among cost, risk, and potential advantage
4. **Distinguishable:** Differs significantly from other COAs (echelon vs. mass, day vs. night, ground vs. air)
5. **Complete:** Addresses Who, What, When, Where, How, and Why for all participating elements; incorporates decisive, shaping, and sustaining operations

**Key Outputs:**
- COA statements (narrative description)
- COA sketches (graphic depiction)
- Updated running estimates
- Revised planning guidance

**Failure Modes:**
- Developing only one COA, eliminating option comparison
- COAs that are not truly distinguishable (cosmetic differences only)
- Incomplete COAs missing task organization or sustainment
- Array of forces without regard to commander's intent
- Failing to consider enemy capabilities in COA development
- Rushing development to meet timeline, producing infeasible options

---

### Step 4: COA Analysis (Wargaming)

**Purpose:** Identify difficulties, coordination problems, and probable consequences of planned actions; develop shared vision of operation.

**The Action-Reaction-Counteraction Sequence:**
1. Friendly ACTION on the battlefield
2. Enemy REACTION to friendly action
3. Friendly COUNTERACTION
4. Cycle repeats

**Wargaming Methods:**
- **Box Method:** Analyzes specific geographic areas
- **Belt Method:** Preferred; analyzes phases or belts across the area of operations
- **Avenue-in-Depth Method:** Follows avenues of approach

**Key Outputs:**
- Synchronization matrix (synchronizes COA across time, space, and purpose)
- Decision Support Template
- Refined COAs with branches and sequels
- War-game results for each COA
- Identified decision points and triggers
- Task organization refinements
- Updated assumptions

**Critical Products Developed:**
- Paragraph 3 (Execution) information for OPORD
- Execution matrices
- Critical events and priority efforts
- Possible fratricide locations
- Combat power requirements

**Failure Modes:**
- This is the most difficult step; staffs frequently struggle here
- Biased wargaming that confirms preferred COA rather than testing all
- Failing to wargame enemy responses realistically
- Not recording advantages and disadvantages systematically
- Premature conclusions or comparing COAs during wargaming (should wait for Step 5)
- Stopping prematurely when COA becomes infeasible (should stop, reject, begin next COA)
- Staff members not involved or understanding their role

---

### Step 5: COA Comparison

**Purpose:** Objectively compare COAs to identify the one with highest probability of success against the most likely enemy COA.

**Decision Matrix Method:**
- Uses evaluation criteria developed during mission analysis
- Criteria can be weighted to emphasize relative importance
- Each COA scored against each criterion
- Totals calculated for both unweighted and weighted comparison

**Sample Criteria and Weights:**
- Accomplishment of essential tasks (weight: 4)
- Force protection (weight: 3)
- Logistical supportability (weight: 3)
- Command and control (weight: 3)
- Simplicity (weight: 3)
- Flexibility (weight: 2)
- Future operations posture (weight: 2)

**Key Outputs:**
- Decision matrix with rankings
- Staff recommendation with rationale
- COA comparison briefing
- Advantages and disadvantages of each COA

**Failure Modes:**
- Arbitrary or unjustified weighting of criteria
- Failing to consider criteria not easily quantified
- Staff recommendation based on personality or "what the boss wants" rather than analysis
- Not conducting sensitivity analysis on critical weights
- Insufficient documentation of reasoning behind scores

---

### Step 6: COA Approval

**Purpose:** Commander selects or modifies a COA for implementation.

**Key Tasks:**
- Present COA comparison briefing
- Commander reviews all COAs and recommendations
- Commander selects, modifies, or develops new COA
- If modified: staff wargames new COA and presents updated results
- Commander provides final planning guidance
- Issue Warning Order #3

**Key Outputs:**
- Approved COA
- Refined commander's intent
- Final planning guidance
- Warning Order #3

**Commander's Options:**
1. Accept staff recommendation
2. Accept different COA from those presented
3. Modify a presented COA (requires additional wargaming)
4. Develop a new COA (rare; requires returning to earlier steps)

**Failure Modes:**
- Commander approval without understanding staff analysis
- Last-minute modifications without wargaming
- Unclear final guidance leading to misinterpretation
- Failing to issue WARNO, compressing subordinate planning time

---

### Step 7: Orders Production

**Purpose:** Convert approved COA into a clear, concise Operation Order (OPORD).

**The Five-Paragraph OPORD Format:**
1. **Situation:** Conditions of operational environment
2. **Mission:** Short description of who, what, when, where, why
3. **Execution:** Commander's intent, concept of operations, subordinate unit instructions
4. **Sustainment:** Logistics, personnel, health service support
5. **Command and Signal:** Command relationships, communications

**Annexes (keep base order concise):**
- Annex A: Task Organization
- Annex B: Intelligence
- Annex C: Operations
- Annex D: Fires
- Annex F: Sustainment
- Annex I: Air and Missile Defense
- (Additional annexes as needed)

**Related Orders:**
- **Warning Order (WARNO):** Preliminary notice; follows five-paragraph format; issued at Steps 1, 2, and 6
- **Fragmentary Order (FRAGO):** Abbreviated form to modify OPORD or execute branch/sequel

**Key Outputs:**
- Complete OPORD with annexes
- Execution matrices
- Decision Support Template
- Synchronization matrix

**Failure Modes:**
- Order too long or complex for subordinates to understand
- Missing critical annexes or unclear task organization
- Ambiguous intent or concept of operations
- Insufficient time for subordinates to receive and process order
- Order not synchronized across all warfighting functions

---

## Running Estimates Throughout

Running estimates are continuous assessments maintained by the commander and each staff section throughout the operations process. Per ADP 5-0, a running estimate is "the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander's intent and if planned future operations are supportable."

**Purpose of Running Estimates:**
- Track current conditions and resources
- Incorporate new information immediately
- Update facts and assumptions
- Identify changes affecting plan viability
- Support rapid decision making during execution

**FM 6-0 Warning:** "Failure to maintain running estimates may lead to errors or omissions that result in flawed plans or bad decisions."

**Running Estimates pivot throughout MDMP:**
- During mission analysis: Focus on understanding situation
- During COA development: Focus on feasibility of options
- During wargaming: Focus on supporting analysis
- During execution: Focus on conclusions, recommendations, risks, and opportunities

**Application to Agent Systems:**
Running estimates are analogous to maintaining state across planning iterations. An agent system should continuously update its understanding of available resources, constraints, and progress rather than treating each decision as independent.

## Time Management: The 1/3-2/3 Rule

**Core Principle:** A military leader should not spend more than 1/3 of the time allocated to accomplish a mission on planning. The remaining 2/3 must be available for subordinate units to conduct their own planning and preparation.

**Example Application:**
- Mission execution in 6 days
- Commander and staff: 2 days (48 hours) maximum for MDMP
- Subordinate units: 4 days for their planning and preparation

**Cascade Effect:**
```
Battalion (1/3):    0600 - 1400 (8 hours)
Companies (2/3):    1400 - 1800 (4 hours for their 1/3)
Platoons (2/3):     1800 - 2400 (6 hours for their 1/3)
Squads (2/3):       2400 onwards
```

**Why This Matters:**
The longer the higher headquarters spends planning, the less time subordinates have. Perfect plans at the top are worthless if subordinate units cannot plan and prepare adequately for their roles.

**Implementation:**
- XO must establish and immediately disseminate MDMP timeline
- Build in contingency time for "murphyisms"
- Time allocation includes planning, preparing, and issuing the order
- Staff planning timeline outlines duration for each MDMP step

---

## Parallel vs. Sequential Planning

### Sequential Planning
Traditional approach where each echelon completes planning before subordinates begin. This consumes the most time but produces the most complete plans.

### Parallel Planning
Two or more echelons plan for the same operation simultaneously. Commanders can initiate MDMP prior to receiving a completed higher headquarters OPORD.

**Requirements for Parallel Planning:**
- Active collaboration between echelons as plan develops
- Staff members maintain contact with higher headquarters counterparts
- Warning orders flow continuously to enable subordinate planning
- Willingness to accept that plans may change as higher headquarters finalizes

**Benefits:**
- Saves 4-6 hours of planning time at battalion level
- Enables subordinates to maximize their planning time
- Supports rapid response to emerging situations

**Challenges:**
- Plans may need adjustment when higher order is finalized
- Requires robust communication between echelons
- Staff members must avoid stovepiped efforts

**Application to Agent Systems:**
Parallel planning is analogous to allowing sub-agents to begin planning based on preliminary guidance while the main orchestrator continues developing the overall approach. This requires clear communication of constraints and intent, plus willingness to adjust as understanding improves.

## Time-Constrained Adaptations

### Abbreviated MDMP

When time is limited, the full MDMP is too slow. However, completely omitting any step often degrades mission success. Instead:

**Methods to Abbreviate:**
1. **Limit COAs:** Commander directs staff to develop single directed COA
2. **Increase commander involvement:** Commander makes more decisions directly rather than awaiting staff analysis
3. **Eliminate or combine briefings:** Reduce formal decision points
4. **Streamline products:** Focus on essential outputs only
5. **Revise or rearrange steps:** Rather than shortening all steps equally

**Caution:** "It is tempting to shorten the amount of time allotted to each step of MDMP; but without enough time, some steps begin to lose their value."

### Rapid Decision-Making and Synchronization Process (RDSP)

RDSP is a streamlined alternative designed for time-constrained environments when traditional MDMP is inappropriate.

**RDSP's Five Steps:**
1. Compare current situation to the order
2. Develop situational template
3. Develop a COA
4. Refine and validate the COA
5. Implement the COA

**Key Differences from MDMP:**
- Prioritizes timely solutions over optimal ones
- Less detail-oriented; much planning occurs mentally
- Omits multiple COAs, decision criteria, and coordinating briefs
- Relies more heavily on commander experience and intuition
- 30-40% quicker decision-making than MDMP
- 15% improved synchronization through emphasis on products over briefs

**Trade-offs:**
Commanders must balance speed, synchronization, and risk acceptance. Effective RDSP requires two of these three elements at any given time.

### Troop Leading Procedures (TLP)

TLP is the small-unit equivalent of MDMP, used by company-level and smaller units that lack formal staffs.

**Eight Steps of TLP:**
1. Receive the mission
2. Issue a warning order
3. Make a tentative plan
4. Initiate movement
5. Conduct reconnaissance
6. Complete the plan
7. Issue the order
8. Supervise and refine

**TLP Under Extreme Time Pressure:**
- All steps should be done, even if abbreviated
- Platoon leader uses 1/3 of time; squad leaders get 2/3
- If insufficient time: conduct fast mental review, post minimum control measures, give abbreviated order
- If still insufficient: move out, issue FRAGO by radio or at next halt
- Continue planning while moving

## Application to Agent Task Planning

The MDMP framework offers several principles directly applicable to AI agent orchestration:

### 1. Structured Problem Decomposition

**MDMP Principle:** Mission analysis breaks down high-level objectives into specified, implied, and essential tasks.

**Agent Application:**
- Break complex requests into explicit tasks (specified)
- Identify unstated but necessary prerequisites (implied)
- Determine which tasks are critical path (essential)
- Ensure mission statement clarity: WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY

### 2. Time Management and Parallel Work

**MDMP Principle:** The 1/3-2/3 rule ensures subordinates have adequate time.

**Agent Application:**
- Allocate processing budget between planning and execution
- Issue early guidance to enable parallel work by sub-agents
- Avoid over-planning at the expense of execution time
- Warning orders enable downstream preparation before complete plan

### 3. Running Estimates as State Management

**MDMP Principle:** Continuously updated situational awareness across all staff functions.

**Agent Application:**
- Maintain explicit state about resources, constraints, and progress
- Update understanding as new information arrives
- Use state to identify when replanning is necessary
- Support rapid decisions during execution with current information

### 4. COA Development and Comparison

**MDMP Principle:** Generate multiple distinguishable options, then compare systematically.

**Agent Application:**
- For complex tasks, generate multiple approaches before committing
- Ensure options are genuinely different (different resources, sequences, or methods)
- Use explicit criteria for selection
- Weight criteria by importance to the specific context

### 5. Wargaming as Pre-Mortem Analysis

**MDMP Principle:** Action-reaction-counteraction anticipates how operations will unfold.

**Agent Application:**
- Before executing a plan, mentally simulate execution
- Identify decision points and triggers for contingencies
- Anticipate failure modes and prepare responses
- Synchronize actions that must be coordinated

### 6. Deliberate vs. Rapid Planning

**MDMP Principle:** Full MDMP when time permits; abbreviated/RDSP when time is short.

**Agent Application:**
- Use full planning process for complex, high-stakes tasks
- Use abbreviated planning for familiar, time-constrained, or low-risk tasks
- Recognize when switching modes is appropriate
- Experience enables faster planning (RDSP relies on commander intuition)

### 7. Products Over Process

**MDMP Principle:** The process produces specific, actionable outputs at each step.

**Agent Application:**
- Define clear deliverables at each planning stage
- Mission Analysis: Restated mission, intent, essential tasks
- COA Development: Distinct approaches with resource assignments
- Orders: Clear, complete instructions for execution
- Products enable communication and coordination

### 8. Failure Modes to Avoid

**From MDMP Experience:**
- Errors early in the process compound as planning continues
- Stovepiped efforts without integration fail at execution
- Plans without rehearsal/validation lose synchronization
- Perfect plans at top level fail if subordinates cannot execute
- Unfamiliarity with the process leads to critical early errors

**Agent Application:**
- Validate understanding before proceeding
- Integrate outputs across parallel work streams
- Test plans before committing to execution
- Ensure all components have adequate context
- Train on the process before deploying in high-stakes situations

## Structured Planning Process for Complex Agent Tasks

Based on MDMP principles, a complex agent task might follow this structure:

### Phase 1: Receipt and Initial Analysis (Step 1)
- Parse and acknowledge the request
- Establish time/resource constraints
- Issue initial understanding to enable parallel preparation
- Determine if full or abbreviated planning is appropriate

### Phase 2: Mission Analysis (Step 2)
- Identify specified tasks (explicitly requested)
- Derive implied tasks (necessary but unstated)
- Designate essential tasks (critical path items)
- Identify assumptions and constraints
- Formulate intent (purpose, method, end state)
- Issue updated understanding with task breakdown

### Phase 3: Approach Development (Step 3)
- Generate 2-3 distinguishable approaches
- For each: outline tasks, resources, sequence
- Screen for feasibility, acceptability, suitability

### Phase 4: Analysis (Step 4)
- Simulate execution of each approach
- Identify coordination requirements
- Anticipate failure modes and decision points
- Develop contingency branches

### Phase 5: Comparison and Selection (Step 5-6)
- Compare approaches against weighted criteria
- Select or modify best approach
- Finalize plan with clear task assignments

### Phase 6: Execution (Step 7+)
- Issue clear instructions to all components
- Maintain running estimates during execution
- Adjust based on emerging information
- Document outcomes for future learning

## When to Use Deliberate vs. Rapid Planning

### Use Full/Deliberate Planning When:
- Task is complex with multiple interdependencies
- Stakes are high and errors are costly
- Sufficient time is available
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Coordination across many components is required
- Situation is unfamiliar or novel

### Use Rapid/Abbreviated Planning When:
- Task is familiar with known solution patterns
- Time pressure is significant
- Situation is clear and well-understood
- Single obvious approach exists
- Quick decision is more valuable than optimal decision
- Execution can be adjusted based on feedback

### Switching Modes:
- Begin with rapid assessment of complexity
- Escalate to deliberate planning if complexity warrants
- If deliberate planning stalls, consider directed COA (commander decides approach)
- Document decision to enable learning

---

## Summary: Key Lessons for Agent Systems

1. **Planning is sequential and cumulative.** Each step builds on previous outputs. Errors early compound later.

2. **Time management is critical.** Balance planning thoroughness against execution time. The 1/3-2/3 rule prevents over-planning.

3. **Running estimates are essential.** Maintain continuous situational awareness to enable rapid adjustment.

4. **Multiple COAs improve outcomes** when there is time to develop and compare them. For time-constrained situations, a directed single COA is acceptable.

5. **Wargaming prevents surprises.** Mental simulation of execution identifies coordination requirements and decision points.

6. **Products enable coordination.** Clear outputs at each step (mission statement, COAs, orders) enable parallel work and communication.

7. **Abbreviated processes exist for good reason.** RDSP and TLP show that trained practitioners can compress the process without losing effectiveness, but this requires experience.

8. **Failure modes are predictable.** Stovepiped efforts, unfamiliarity with process, compressed timelines, poor running estimates, and biased analysis are consistent failure patterns.
