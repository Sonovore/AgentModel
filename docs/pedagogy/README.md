# Pedagogy

Mental models from pedagogy (teaching and learning theory) applied to AI agent development, progressive skill building, and human-agent knowledge transfer.

## Purpose

Pedagogy addresses how expertise develops through scaffolded instruction, progressive complexity, and guided practice. Rather than dumping all knowledge at once, effective teaching builds mental models progressively through carefully designed interactions. These principles apply to how humans can effectively guide AI agent development, how agents might teach other agents or humans, and how to structure learning within multi-agent systems. These patterns address continuous development rather than static capability.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Guided Development

### Assessment and Adaptation

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Formative Assessment | Educational assessment | Ongoing feedback during learning |
| Learning Objectives | Instructional design | Clear targets for what should be learned |
| Diagnostic Assessment | Education practice | Understanding current knowledge/skills |
| Adaptive Pathways | Personalized learning | Different learning sequences for different learners |
| Mastery-Based Progression | Learning design | Advancing based on competence, not time |

### Domain-Specific Teaching

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|

## Key Questions

1. How do you identify the "zone of proximal development" for an AI agent?
2. What "scaffolding" looks like for agent tasks - temporary support structures?
3. How do agents build and update internal mental models?
4. When should you use "leading questions" vs directly demonstrating to agents?
5. What feedback mechanisms help agents learn and improve?
6. How do you design progressive complexity for long-term agent development?
7. Can agents teach each other or humans - what pedagogical principles apply?
8. What constitutes "mastery" or "competence" for agents in a domain?
