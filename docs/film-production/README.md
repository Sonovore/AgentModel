# Film Production

Mental models from film production applied to AI agent phase-based projects, hierarchical delegation, and resource marshaling.

## Purpose

Film production demonstrates large-scale coordination across distinct phases (development, pre-production, production, post-production) with different requirements and team compositions at each stage. The system excels at marshaling diverse resources toward a common creative vision while managing complexity through clear hierarchies, documentation, and adaptation. These patterns address how AI agents can coordinate through large, phase-based projects with shifting requirements.

## Status

**Current phase:** Identification - listing relevant models, not yet researching.

## Mental Models to Explore

### Phase-Based Workflows

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Phase-Based Project Structure | Film development | Different activities and priorities in each phase |
| Development Phase | Pre-production | Creative vision and planning before execution |
| Pre-Production Phase | Production planning | Detailed preparation before resource-intensive phase |
| Production Phase | Filming | Resource-intensive phase with strict schedules |
| Post-Production Phase | Finishing | Editing, effects, and refinement after principal production |

### Hierarchical Delegation

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Director Vision | Creative leadership | Central creative authority |
| Department Heads | Production hierarchy | Specialists managing specific domains |
| Delegation Authority | Production management | Clear authority for each lead |
| Creative Direction | Production process | Vision cascading through organizational hierarchy |
| Autonomous Decision-Making | Department-level | Teams making decisions within domain boundaries |

### Resource Marshaling

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Budget Management | Production operations | Allocating finite resources across phases and activities |
| Scheduling and Sequencing | Production planning | Coordinating when resources are deployed |
| Call Sheets | Production practice | Daily assignment of resources and activities |
| Location Management | Film production | Coordinating complex logistics |
| Equipment and Crew Allocation | Production operations | Matching resources to requirements |

### Documentation and Coordination

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Documentation as Coordination | Film practice | Scripts, storyboards, shot lists enable coordination |
| Script and Narrative | Production planning | Single source of truth for what happens |
| Storyboarding | Pre-production | Visual planning to coordinate teams |
| Shot Lists | Production planning | Precise coordination of what to film |
| Continuity and Records | Production discipline | Tracking what has been shot and consistency |

### Below-the-Line Management

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Below-the-Line Specialization | Film hierarchy | Technical specialists operating with autonomy |
| Department Operations | Production structure | Each department managing its own workflow |
| Crew Autonomy | Film practice | Specialists making tactical decisions |
| Technical Problem-Solving | Below-the-line work | Departments solving problems within their domain |
| Communication Hierarchy | Production set | Messages flowing through department leads |

### Real-Time Coordination

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Set Coordination | Production day | Real-time management of resources and timing |
| Assistant Director Role | Production hierarchy | Coordinating execution to maintain schedule |
| Crew Positioning | Film set | Coordinating physical locations and responsibilities |
| Call and Response | Production communication | Clear communication of status and direction |
| Contingency Protocols | Production practice | Handling unexpected problems during filming |

### Quality and Learning

| Model | Source | Why It Might Apply |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Dailies Review | Post-production preview | Regular assessment of output quality |
| Reshoots | Production adaptation | Revisiting work when quality is insufficient |
| Test Screenings | Post-production testing | Gathering feedback before final release |
| Cutting and Editing | Post-production | Refining based on accumulated footage |
| Lessons Learned | Production wrap | Capturing knowledge for future projects |

## Priority Assessment

| Model | Relevance | Complexity | Suggested Priority |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Phase-Based Project Structure** | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| **Hierarchical Delegation** | Very High | Medium | 1 - Critical |
| **Documentation as Coordination** | High | Low | 1 |
| **Director Vision** | High | Medium | 1 |
| **Resource Marshaling** | High | High | 2 |
| **Below-the-Line Management** | High | Medium | 2 |
| **Set Coordination** | High | Medium | 2 |
| **Budget Management** | Medium | High | 2 |
| **Dailies Review** | Medium | Low | 3 |

## Key Questions

1. How do you map film production phases to agent project lifecycle?
2. What does "director vision" look like for agent systems?
3. How do you document requirements in ways that coordinate agent activity?
4. What delegation patterns work for distributed agent teams?
5. How do agents adapt when encountering "unexpected problems" (like contingencies in production)?
6. What's the agent equivalent of "dailies review" - quality assessment during project?
7. How do you marshal resources (computational, data, etc.) across project phases?
